    <div class="section-title">Is there a jailbreak for the latest Kindle firmware?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Yes. As of September 2025, the new <b>AdBreak jailbreak</b> works on firmware <b>5.18.1 through 5.18.5</b>, but only on devices with
        <b>Special Offers (ads) enabled</b>. It does not remove ads by itself — you still need Amazon to disable them afterward or use scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your device is on <b>5.18.0 or lower</b>, use <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/" target="_blank">WinterBreak</a>.  
        If you are on <b>5.18.1–5.18.3 without ads</b> (such as Scribe models or unsupported regions), stay offline and wait for the upcoming
        <b>Unnamed Jailbreak (UJ)</b>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">AdBreak is very new – what should I know?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        AdBreak was released in September 2025 and is still considered experimental. Issues are being discovered as more people try it,
        and solutions will be added here over time. Always read the
        <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/AdBreak/" target="_blank">official AdBreak guide</a>
        before attempting it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">What if my Kindle doesn’t support ads?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Some models, such as the <b>Scribe</b>, never supported ads at all — AdBreak will not work on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some countries, Amazon does not offer ad-supported Kindles. A workaround is to
        <b>switch your Amazon account region</b> to a supported country (US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, JP, CN).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already paid Amazon to remove ads, you can re-enable them for free in your account settings, jailbreak, and then disable them again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I downgrade my Kindle’s firmware?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        No, not unless your Kindle is already jailbroken. There’s no official way to downgrade a stock (unjailbroken) Kindle.
        Jailbroken users can sometimes downgrade using custom scripts; see the
        <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downgrading/" target="_blank">downgrade guide</a> for more info.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">How do I jailbreak my Kindle?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Check your Kindle’s firmware version, then follow the correct guide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>5.18.1–5.18.5 (ads enabled):</b> <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/AdBreak/" target="_blank">AdBreak Jailbreak</a></li>
        <li><b>5.18.0 and lower:</b> <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/" target="_blank">WinterBreak Jailbreak</a></li>
        <li><b>5.18.1–5.18.3 without ads:</b> Stay offline and wait for the Unnamed Jailbreak (UJ)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Do I need an Amazon account linked to my Kindle to jailbreak?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Yes, for AdBreak and WinterBreak your Kindle must be registered to an Amazon account with WiFi set up to download ads.
        Older legacy jailbreaks sometimes did not require this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I jailbreak a deregistered or blacklisted Kindle?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Usually not—unless your device is on specific old firmware and you use legacy exploits like LanguageBreak or WatchThis.
        See the <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/" target="_blank">official jailbreak guide</a> for details.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Will jailbreaking erase my books or highlights?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        No, jailbreaking itself will not erase your books or highlights. Still, always back up your Kindle just in case.
        Note: Amazon may remotely remove some sideloaded books when you reconnect to WiFi, whether your device is jailbroken or not.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Will jailbreaking void my warranty or get my Amazon account banned?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Jailbreaking will likely void your warranty. There are no confirmed cases of Amazon banning accounts for jailbreaking,
        but you should never discuss mods or hacks with Amazon support.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I remove the jailbreak and restore my Kindle to stock?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A factory reset will remove most user data and disable jailbreak features, but some traces may remain.
        For a complete restore, update your Kindle to the latest official firmware after resetting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">How can I block Kindle automatic updates?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        The safest way is to keep your Kindle in Airplane Mode.
        Some advanced users fill up their Kindle’s storage or use scripts to block updates,
        but Airplane Mode is the easiest and safest for most people.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I still use the Amazon Store and all regular Kindle features after jailbreaking?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Yes. Jailbreaking does not remove or break normal Kindle features, including the store, cloud sync, and the built-in Kindle reader.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">How do I install KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher)?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Copy the correct <b>Update_KUALBooklet*.bin</b> or hotfix install file to your Kindle’s root, safely eject,
        then go to Settings → Update Your Kindle. If you get errors after updates, install the KUAL hotfix booklet.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">KOReader or KUAL isn’t opening, or throws errors after updating. What should I do?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Make sure you have the correct version for your firmware.
        Some updates require a KUAL hotfix, and KOReader has different builds for different firmware.
        For detailed help, see the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=357438" target="_blank">KOReader thread</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I sideload books or use the default Kindle reader after jailbreaking?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Yes! Jailbreaking does not affect your ability to sideload books or use the regular Kindle reader.
        Most Kindle and third-party reading functions will work as before.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Can I install Android apps, or use Libby/Goodreads/Send To Kindle after jailbreaking?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        You cannot run Android apps unless there is a specific port or extension.
        Built-in Kindle features (Goodreads, Send To Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, etc.) still work after jailbreaking.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">What’s the difference between soft-float and hard-float firmware?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Kindles on firmware 5.16.3 and newer use “hard-float” (hardware floating point support);
        older devices use “soft-float.” Some mods or extensions only work on one or the other, so always check compatibility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">How do I know if my Kindle is jailbroken?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Type <b>;log</b> into the Kindle search bar. If you see a popup message, your device is jailbroken.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">What should I do if something goes wrong, or my Kindle is stuck?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        Try restarting your Kindle and reinstalling the hotfix and KUAL.
