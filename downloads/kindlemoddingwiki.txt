Downgrading Your Kindle

A jailbroken Kindle is required - You cannot downgrade a Kindle on stock firmware
Before You Start

- You do this at your own risk
- You obviously cannot downgrade to a lower firmware than the one your Kindle originally had. You also cannot downgrade with updates marked for other devices different than yours
- Backup any important data from your Kindle as this process will wipe everything in the device
- Restore OTA updates (../../jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/disable-ota) (Click on Restore)
- Disable USBNetwork (USBMS mode) if you have the USBNetwork extension installed
Prerequisites
- A PC
- A jailbroken Kindle (using the Universal Hotfix (../../jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix))
- Appropriate Update Firmware .bin you want to downgrade (../downloading-updates).
Downgrading
1. Turn on Airplane Mode, disable USBNetwork and enable OTA updates.
2. Download the Allow Downgrade scriplet (./AllowDowngrade.sh) created by Marek (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/member.php?u=340787).
3. Plug your Kindle into your PC and copy the scriplet into the documents folder.
4. Eject and unplug your Kindle.
5. Navigate your library and click on the "Allow Downgrade" booklet.
6. Your Kindle will print text on screen for a couple of seconds and will return to the library menu. Downgrading should be enabled now.
7. Copy the updatekindle*.bin file to your Kindle root directory. Do not unplug your Kindle, hold the power button until your device reboots.
8. Your Kindle will now install the firmware you copied to it.
Post-Downgrading

Congratulations! Your Kindle has been downgraded.

Devices using the Universal Hotfix will need to re-install it and re-run the booklet.

Large jumps in firmware versions might cause your Kindle to display a white screen after downgrading. This can be easily fixed by plugging your Kindle back into your PC, sideload an empty file named DOFACTORYRESTORE (without extension) into the root directory and force a reboot by holding the power button for 20 or 30 seconds.

Keep in mind that not every extension out there was not made for hard float firmware (>=5.16.3) or soft float firmware (<=5.16.2.1.1), if you make a jump between those two updates, make sure you're installing the correct packages and extensions.

Some devices may let you skip the initial device set-up by simply restarting the device. But if your device keeps prompting the set-up, do it quickly (skipping Wi-Fi), and then delete the partial OTA download located in your Kindle root directory.

After downgrading, you will need to re-do the post-jailbreak instructions:

Setting Up A Hotfix (../../jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix/)

Manually Downloading Firmware Update Files
At the time of writing, Amazon does not delete Kindle Firmware Update files from their servers, meaning that it is possible to download any firmware version, simply by changing the link.
Installing Updates
You can easily install downloaded Kindle Updates
1. Place your Kindle in Airplane Mode
2. Plug your Kindle into your PC
3. Copy the downloaded update file to the root of your Kindle (the same location as the documents folder)
4. Eject and unplug your Kindle
5. On your Kindle open settings, then from the top-right menu, select Update Your Kindle
Update Links
Note that K1, K2, DX and K3 are not included in the table as they require different firmwares based on serial numbers, please see the Amazon page (https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW) for those models

This table contains the last jailbreakable firmware for each Kindle as a link. Note that Kindles which cannot be jailbroken (>PW5) or particularly old devices (<PW3) simply have links to the latest firmwares at the time of writing. Always make sure what you're downloading before you update!

Firmware and Flashing
It is possible to update your Kindle's firmware to a specific version, note, it is not possible to DOWNGRADE it to a specific version, only to update.

Additionally, with a 1.8v Serial-to-USB Adapter soldered to your Kindle, it is possible to flash firmwares directly, and even Android!

===== firmware-and-flashing/kv-flash-new-firmware.md =====

Forcing KV to run 5.14+
Thanks to katadelos (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=343385) for figuring this out.

This is extremely advanced and can brick your Kindle Voyage. This is also highly experimental. There will be little support if things go wrong as there are few people who can even help you recover if this goes wrong.

In terms of hardware, like iPhones, the PW3 and KV are almost identical. They have an identical partition layout, meaning that it is possible to cross-flash the firmware from one device to another.
In fact, even the KT2 with 256MB of ram can run 5.14+ (https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/qvgerd/teachingolddogsnewtricksnewestupdate/)... although, the 5.13.7+ React UI certainly takes up more resources and can cause instabilities from memory consumption.

This can theoretically be done to any device in the Wario hardware family (PW2, PW3, KT2, KV) EXCEPT for the PW2 as it has a slightly smaller RootFS than the rest, as Neon found out, unfortunately (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=348801). Whilst it is theoretically possible, modifications to the image are needed.

By following this guide, I bear no responsibility if you break your Kindle, caused a house fire, or accidentally open up a wormhole to the 818th dimension. You have been warned!

This should ONLY be attempted on Kindle Voyages with 512MB RAM. Even then, caution should be used as there is presumably a reason 5.14.1 did not ship on the Voyage...
Prerequisites
- A Kindle Voyage
- A 1.8v USB-to-Serial adapter soldered to the Kindle Voyage
- Software which can access the serial port installed, such as PuTTY (https://www.putty.org/)
- NiLuJe's KindleTool (https://github.com/NiLuJe/KindleTool) installed
- A PW3 Update File (see Manually Downloading Firmware Update Files (./downloading-updates.html))
Extracting the image and flashing your Kindle
1. Extract the PW3 update file via KindleTool as shown:
    ~~~bash
    kindletool extract ~/Downloads/updatekindleallnewpaperwhite_5.XX.X.bin /tmp/pw3
    ~~~
    (replace the path to the file to wherever you saved yours)
2. Extract the rootfs.img file from the rootfs.img.gz fle as so:
    ~~~bash
    gzip -d /tmp/pw3/rootfs.img.gz
    ~~~
3. Make sure you have PuTTY launched and connected to the Kindle's serial port (use baudrate 115200bps)
4. Boot the Kindle and interrupt the boot process by rapidly hitting enter until you see uboot >
5. Boot into DIAGS mode by running the command:
    ~~~bash
    uboot > bootm 0xE41000
    ~~~
6. Once you are in DIAGS mode, run the following command to export the userspace partition:
    ~~~bash
    usb export
    ~~~
7. COPY the rootfs.img file to the Kindle
    
    DO NOT FLASH THE IMAGE ONTO THE KINDLE. Simply copy it to the device via your preffered file manager.
8. Eject the Kindle from the PC BUT DO NOT UNPLUG IT
9. Exit USB Export mode by entering x at the prompt
10. Exit DIAGS mode and enter a shell by running:
    ~~~bash
    exit login
    ~~~
11. Run the following command to begin flashing your Kindle:
    ~~~bash
    dd if=/mnt/us/rootfs.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=4096
    ~~~
12. Reboot your Kindle via the following command:
    ~~~bash
    reboot
    ~~~

If everything works, the Kindle should boot to whichever firmware you flashed.

If your Kindle does not boot, try flashing it again

AdBreak
If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way.

\- Martin Luther King, Jr.

AdBreak is a jailbreak released on 24/09/2025 by hhhhhhhhh.

It is based on CVE-2012-3748 (https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2017/05/ode-to-use-after-free-one-vulnerable.html).
Scribe devices must be using a French account to enable ads
Special thanks to Chris Evans (@scarybeasts) for a lot of the exploit code, hackerdude for the modified JB script.
Prerequisites

- You will need a PC, cable
- Non-blacklisted, registered, ad-enabled Kindle
- Firmware 5.18.1 and above (possibly patched after 5.18.5.0.1)

If you face any issues, please check the troubleshooting (#troubleshooting) section. It also includes details on how you could possibly re-enable ads on a kindle which does not have them at present.

        Previous Step
        
        Next Step
    
    
        
            Download the latest AdBreak release:
            
                Download
                
                    If your Kindle is is not yet registered, make sure to follow these steps to prevent your Kindle from automatically updating before registering your device with Amazon. This will help you avoid an automatic firmware update during the registration process.
                
                
                    Please use WinterBreak on firmware 5.18.0.2 and below.
                
            
        
        
            Download Ads
            
                Leave your kindle for a while, connected to the internet, so it can download advertisements. If you press the lock button, an advertisement should be displayed. If advertisements aren't being downloaded after a while, a factory reset may help.
            
        
        
            Aeroplane Mode
            
                Once you have verified ads are displayed on the lockscreen, enable airplane mode.
                 
            
        
        
            View all ads

Troubleshooting
FAQ

- The JB does NOT automatically remove advertisements, see Marek's scriptlet.
- It will never work on the CS/Colorsoft! Ads can NOT be re-enabled there!
- No, this is not "UJ"/"Unnamed Jailbreak". That is separate.
- "Is there a way to make my device ad supported?" (see below)
Common Issues

- Can't find the system folder:
    - On mass storage kindles, if you cannot see the system folder, you will have to navigate to the path manually, or follow this (https://kb.blackbaud.com/knowledgebase/Article/41890) guide to see protected system folders. 
- "Bang!" shows but the jailbreak doesn't run:
    - Check the .assets folder on the Kindle. "jb.sh" and "patchedUks.sqsh" must be in there.
Enabling Ads
(needed for jailbreak, safe to remove later)

- Switch account region  
   - Go to Manage Your Content and Devices → Preferences → Country/Region Settings → Change.  
   - Select one of: US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, JP, CN  
   - Use valid details (address, phone, email).

- Add payment method  
   - Set a default credit card and billing address matching the chosen region.  
   - No charge should occur.

- Enable special offers  
   - In your Amazon account, turn on Special Offers for your Kindle.

- Sync kindle  
   - Connect to Wi-Fi, eventually ads will appear on lockscreen.

Notes:  
- If your kindle originally had no ads, re-disabling later is free.  
- If your kindle is an ads model, disabling normally costs a one-time fee, but can be removed post-jb with a script.

===== jailbreaking/Legacy/backing-up/backing-up.md =====

Backing Up Your Kindle
This guide will briefly go over how to back-up your Kindle's partitions, allowing you to recover it if it becomes bricked.
This only works on Kindle's which are 8th generation or OLDER, such as:
- PW2
- PW3
- KT2
- KT3
- KV
- KOA

This is because newer devices such as the KT4/PW4 have different partition layouts as well as secure boot,  making it impossible to resture backed up partitions.
Prerequisites
- A computer
- A Jailbroken Kindle with KUAL installed
- kterm (https://github.com/bfabiszewski/kterm) installed on your Kindle
- knc1's Kindle Backup Script (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=289690)
Backing up your Kindle
1. Plug your Kindle into your computer
2. Download the latest (https://github.com/bfabiszewski/kterm/releases/latest) kterm zip file
3. Extract the kterm folder into the extensions folder on your Kindle
4. Extract the backup-0.3.tar.gz file (knc1's backup script) somewhere on your computer
5. Copy the esys and unjail folders to the root of your Kindle when plugged in (same place as documents folder)
6. Eject and unplug your Kindle
7. Go to KUAL > kterm
8. Type the following commands:
    ~~~bash
    cd /mnt/us/unjail
    ./mkbackup.sh
    exit
    ~~~
    The ./mkbackup.sh step may take a few minutes as it backs up your Kindle
9. Plug the Kindle back into your computer
10. There should be a backups folder, this contains your Kindle's system images, make sure you copy it to a safe location!

If you ever want to back up your Kindle again, you can start from step 7, assuming you didn't remove kterm or the backup script

Backing Up
8th Generation and older jailbroken Kindles can have their partitions backed up and restored in case of catastrophic failures.
This only works on Kindle's which are 8th generation or OLDER, such as:
- PW2
- PW3
- KT2
- KT3
- KV
- KOA

This is because newer devices such as the KT4/PW4 have different partition layouts as well as secure boot,  making it impossible to resture backed up partitions.

Restoring Your Kindle
If your Kindle becomes bricked and you have a backup (./backing-up.html), then you can restore it as so:
This only works on Kindle's which are 8th generation or OLDER, such as:
- PW2
- PW3
- KT2
- KT3
- KV
- KOA

This is because newer devices such as the KT4/PW4 have different partition layouts as well as secure boot,  making it impossible to resture backed up partitions.
Prerequisites
- A computer
- Soldering and Electronics Expertise
- A 1.8v Serial to USB Adapter connected to a Kindle
- Software which can access the serial port installed, such as PuTTY (https://www.putty.org/)
Restoring up your Kindle
1. Make sure that PuTTY is installed
2. Open a serial connection to your Kindle, the baud rate is usually 115200bps
3. Boot the Kindle and interrupt the boot process by rapidly hitting enter until you see uboot >
4. Once you see uboot >, boot into DIAGS by entering the command: boom 0xE41000
5. Once you are in DIAGS, export the userpace partition by running the usb export command
6. Then, copy your RootFS image file to the Kindle. Make sure you name it rootfs.img
    
    DO NOT FLASH THE KINDLE OR WRITE THE IMAGE TO IT DIRECTLY. Simply copy the image file to the Kindle
8. Eject BUT DO NOT UNPLUG your Kindle
9. Exit DIAGS mode by entering x at the prompt and enter a shell using the following command: exit login
10. Now we will flash your RootFS image on the Kindle, simply run the following command: dd if=/mnt/us/rootfs.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=4096
11. Once it is finished, simply reboot the device via the reboot command

With any luck, your Kindle should reboot good as new!

Troubleshooting

If an “Unexpected error” occurs when you try to log in to the Kindle Store or only the Kindle Store home page is displayed, try the following solutions:
LocalStorage Replacement

1. After successfully registered, plug your Kindle into your PC and delete the .activecontentsandbox folder,  make sure to also delete any files with a name similar to update.bin.tmp.partial from your Kindle to prevent an automatic update
2. Reboot your Kindle
3. Disable Airplane mode and connect to a WiFi connection
4. Browse the regular Kindle Store for a couple of minutes to generate the files needed for Winterbreak to work, browse the book categories and download a free sample of any book
5. After a couple of minutes, enable Airplane mode and plug your Kindle into your PC again
6. Delete the cache directory in the path .activecontentsandbox/store/resource/LocalStorage. If this folder has not yet been generated, browse the Kindle Store for another couple of minutes until it is generated. Make sure to always delete the previously mentioned update.bin.tmp.partial file, especially before any rebooting
7. Once deleted, copy the Winterbreak files to your Kindle and reboot
8. Open the Kindle Store on your Kindle, when prompted, click Yes to turn off Airplane mode
Factory Reset
Faced this error and found a solution DiabloSat (https://github.com/progzone122) & Rexathion1 (https://github.com/Rexathion1)

1. Factory Reset your Kindle
2. Before registering - plug your Kindle into your PC, move the WinterBreak files to the root of your storage space
3. Login to your account, and enable Airplane mode as soon as possible
4. Connect your Kindle into your PC and delete the cache directory at the path .activecontentsandbox/store/resource/LocalStorage (skip this step if the LocalStorage directory does not exist)
5. Reboot your Kindle
6. Open the Kindle Store on your Kindle
7. When prompted, click Yes to turn off Airplane mode

Getting Started
In order to jailbreak your Kindle, you will need to know which Kindle you have and then pick a method to jailbreak it.
What Kindle Do You Have?
Unlike Amazon, the Kindle Modding community, such as this Wiki and MobileRead reffers to Kindle models by their nicknames, ie: the PW4 referring to the Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation)

This is important to note due to the fact that many Kindle jailbreaks only work on specific models.

Questions about Jailbreaking?
Before attempting to jailbreak your Kindle, we strongly recommend reading the Kindle Jailbreak F.A.Q as it provides answers to common questions and issues.

Jailbreaking Your Kindle
Jailbreaking a Kindle:
- Allows devs to create system modifications or extensions to extend the functionality of the device further.
- Also allows for the development of custom homebrew to run on the Kindle
- Why not?
What can I do?
As a user, this gives you access to:
- Custom screensavers
- Custom fonts on firmwares that do not support it
- Homebrew such as apps, games and more
- Downgrading your firmware (../firmware-and-flashing/downgrading)
Please be aware of the risks of jailbreaking before you jailbreak your Kindle including, but not limited to:
- Potentially voiding the Kindle's waranty
- Bricking (permanently breaking) the device
- Security Risks

Always jailbreak at your own risk.
If you don't know what you are doing or are unsure, don't do it.

Frequently Asked Questions

We recommend reading this article before or after jailbreaking your Kindle device and share it with other people.

Most of these instructions are subjected to changes due to newer jailbreaks, patches, extensions, firmware versions, etc. (Last updated: May 24th, 2025)
General/Account
---
Can I jailbreak my Kindle with Winterbreak if my device is unregistered/blacklisted?

Winterbreak needs your Kindle to be registered, it also needs a valid, internet-connected WiFi network saved.

It's still possible to jailbreak an unregistered/blacklisted device, but currently, the only jailbreaking methods for those devices work on or below firmware 5.16.2.1.1. You can find these jailbreaking methods in Legacy Jailbreaks (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/Legacy/).
My Kindle updated to a firmware version that doesn't have any jailbreak method! Can I still jailbreak it?

No.

You'll have to wait for a new jailbreak method (or patch) to be released. This may take weeks or even months. To protect your Kindle from automatic updates, forget all saved internet connections, enable Airplane mode, and wait.

If you still want to use the internet on your Kindle while avoiding automatic updates, you might find this guide helpful (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/prevent-auto-update.html).
Can I downgrade my Kindle so I can jailbreak it?

No.

Your Kindle must be jailbroken first in order to downgrade. This is because Amazon has never provided a way to downgrade on stock firmware.
Can I remove my account after jailbreaking?

Yes, but you will have to log in again if you want to jailbreak from scratch. The jailbreak will still work whether you log back in or log out. 

After unregistering, the Kindle will delete all files located in the documents folder, including the KUAL Launcher booklet and any other scripts that have been transferred. Be sure to back up these files first.
Can I un-jailbreak my Kindle?

Yes, perform a factory reset on the device and then install the same firmware update (or higher). 

Don't forget to re-enable automatic updates first (Restore option in renametobin) to avoid an update block. 
Will this get my Amazon account banned?

No reports of Amazon accounts being banned after jailbreaking have been reported so far. However, please refrain from telling support that you have modified your device.
Will this void the warranty on my Kindle device?
Probably.
How do I get the Amazon store back again?

Read and follow this guide (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/re-enabling-the-store/).
What does soft-float and hard-float firmware means?

Starting with version 5.16.3, Kindles started using hard-float architecture (on-chip floating point unit) for most processing tasks, compared to the soft-float architecture, which emulated in software.

While the underlying system appears mostly the same, many internal changes have made a lot of jailbreaking tools and extensions unusable in modern firmware versions.

This ultimately means that most extensions found on MobileRead/Discord servers won't work on hard-float firmware or viceversa unless explicitly stated (i.e NiLuJe's Screensaverhack).
Apps and eBooks
---
Can I still use the default reader after jailbreaking?

Yes.
Can I still sideload books after jailbreaking?

Yes.
Will my books and highlights be deleted after jailbreaking?

No.

if your device has been in Airplane mode for a long period of time, there is a possibility that Amazon will delete all sideloaded books (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4419300&postcount=409) from your device after reconnecting to WiFi due to an internal book tag. This can happen regardless of whether your device is jailbroken or not.
Will Libby/Readwise/GoodReads/Kindle Unlimited/Send To Kindle still work after jailbreaking?

Yes. Jailbreaking doesn’t interfere with any of these services.
Can I use those applications within KOReader?

Unless there's a plugin for it, no.
Can I install Android apps on my jailbroken Kindle (Libby, Nook, Webtoon)?

Unless there's a extension/port for any of them, no.
How do I read my Amazon ebooks within KOReader?

KOReader currently doesn’t (and likely never will) support the proprietary formats that Amazon converts all ebooks into (KFX, AZW3, and very limited support for MOBI). It is recommended to get all your books as EPUB and store them in a separate folder for easy access.
How do I read my Libby books?

You cannot use the Libby service within KOReader. You can get the EPUB file from Libby by following this guide (https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6059.htm).
Where can I download free e-books?

You can Google this.
KOReader
---
What is the difference between the three KOReader launch options?

- "Start KOReader": The designed way to start KOReader.
- "Start KOReader (no framework)": Temporarily "kills" the Kindle UI to allocate more resources to KOReader.
- "Start KOReader (ASAP)": Skips a couple of checks and starts KOReader as soon as possible.
I can't no longer transfer files through USB while I am on KOReader!

KOReader currently does not support USBMS mode (USB transfer) and will only charge the device, if you want to transfer files you must exit KOReader to do so. 
Do I have to launch KOReader through KUAL?

Not necessarily.

You can launch it with simple scriptlets (https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/scriptlets.html), specifically, Marek's launcher that is available here (https://scriptlets.notmarek.com/).

A KUAL booklet launcher (made by yparitcher) (https://github.com/yparitcher/KUALBooklet/releases/) extension is also available to install. You can further customize both the KUAL booklet and the KOR launcher with the coversetter extension made by Stanner (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4222466&postcount=15).
Technical
---
What is the "root directory"?

It's the first directory you see when you plug the device into your computer.

If you have SSH access to the device, this directory can be found at /mnt/us/.
Can I update/factory reset/downgrade my Kindle after jailbreaking?

Yes, but you must first enable Airplane mode and enable automatic updates again (Restore option in renametobin) to avoid any potential self-blocks or unwanted automatic updates.

When updating, ensure that the newer version supports a jailbreak.

After updating/factory reset/downgrading, re-install the hotfix from scratch. KUAL and some others extensions may need to be re-installed too.
How do I downgrade my Kindle?

Read and follow this guide (https://kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downgrading/#downgrading-your-kindle).
Where can I download firmware update files?

Read and follow this guide (https://kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downloading-updates.html).

Find your exact model, find the download link and re-type the numbers to get the firmware version you want.
How do I use Scriptlets (.sh)?

As explained in the Scriptlets section (https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/scriptlets.html#siptlets), copy the scriptlet file into the documents folder (/documents). Once you're in the library view mode on Kindle, simply click on it.
How can I check that the automatic updates have been disabled after using renametobin?

Download the "Check OTA Status" scriptlet from here (https://scriptlets.notmarek.com/)
Is it possible to change screensavers in the native Kindle UI?

Although there are currently no extensions to change the screensavers in hard-float firmware, it is still possible to change them, but it is not recommended as it is very easy to brick the device.

If you still want to change the screensavers, check the details of your default Kindle screensavers inside the /usr/share/blanket/screensavers folder, get root writing permissions, and set the custom ones with the same name prefix and settings (bit-depth and resolution). You can either replace them all or add them to the slideshow queue.

Please note that even after following these precautions, it is not guaranteed your device won’t brick, especially if you're using GIMP to export the images.

If you are, however, running soft-float firmware prior to or on 5.16.2.1.1 you can install NiLuJe's screensaver hack (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=195474). Please do not make the mistake of installing this extension on hard-float firmware.

You can easily change screensavers with KOReader (https://koreader.rocks/userguide/) (search for the "screensavers" feature).
Jailbreaking
---
How can I check if my device is jailbroken?

Type ;log into the search bar, if a message pop ups, you're jailbroken.
KUAL stopped working!/I can't no longer launch any of my extensions!
Verify if your device is still jailbroken by typing log; into the search bar.

- If it prompted any text, re-install the hotfix and KUAL (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix/) from scratch.
- If not re-jailbreak (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/getting-started.html) your device.
- If everything else failed, factory reset your device and start the jailbreak from scratch. 
I can't no longer update my Kindle after a factory reset/update!

If you reset your Kindle in a jailbroken state with renametobin enabled, then your Kindle may be in a broken state, to fix this, read this guide (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/recovering-from-a-reset.html).
I get a message saying "Failed to remount rootfs RO, waiting"!

This is expected, you can safely reboot your device manually (holding the power button until you get the Restart option)
My device hasn't rebooted after the jailbreaking pop-up!

Unless the Kindle displays in small text the message: “You are now ready to install the hotfix”, you can safely reboot and continue with the post-jailbreak instructions. If not, something wrong happened in the jailbreak process.

Remember to delete any automatic update file that might have appeared.
I kept getting random "KPPMainAppV2" books added to my Kindle library, what should I do!?

Kindles usually generate those books after detecting any kind of error (mostly common after exiting KOReader frameworkless), you can safely delete them. You can also disable the generation of these books by creating an empty file named DISABLECOREDUMP to the visible USB storage root of your device.

This is also the case for the "Collecting Debug Info" message.
I have successfully jailbroken my device, what now?

You can do one of the following:

- Install KOReader (https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/koreader.html)
- Downgrade your Kindle (https://kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downgrading/)
- Download some scriptlets (https://scriptlets.notmarek.com/)
- Develop more extensions (https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/) 
- Browse MobileRead (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=150) or the Kindle Modding Community Discord Server for more scriplets and extensions.

                    Firmware >=5.11.x:
                    Unzip and copy the renameotabin folder to the extensions folder on your Kindle
                    Delete any file with a name similar to update.bin.tmp.partial or ending in .bin from your Kindle to prevent an automatic update
                
            
        

            Disconnect
            
                
                    Firmware 
                    Safely eject your Kindle from your computer
                    Unplug the USB cable from your Kindle
                    No further action is needed - OTA updates are now disabled
                
                
                    Firmware >=5.11.x:
                    Safely eject your Kindle from your computer
                    Unplug the USB cable from your Kindle
                
            
        

            Final steps
            
                
                    Firmware 
                    No additional steps needed
                   
                
                    Firmware >=5.11.x:
                    Open KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher)
                    Select Rename OTA Binaries from the menu
                    Select Rename
                    Your Kindle will now reboot automatically
                
            
        

            Done
            
                Your Kindle is now jailbroken with OTA updates disabled!    
                
                    Firmware 
                    To restore OTA updates, simply delete the update.bin.tmp.partial folder
                
                
                    Firmware >=5.11.x:
                    If you want to factory reset, downgrade or update your Kindle, you will need to restore the update binaries by opening KUAL, selecting Rename OTA Binaries and then selecting Restore instead of rename
                
                You can now safely turn off Airplane Mode and re-enable WiFi. Your Kindle will connect to the internet but will not download or install OTA updates.

Post Jailbreak
Once you have jailbroken your Kindle, there are still some extremely important steps you will need to perform described in this section of the Wiki

Turn on Airplane mode now so your Kindle doesn't automatically update to latest firmware before applying OTArenamer!

Setup a hotfix (./setting-up-a-hotfix)

===== jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/index.md =====

Installing KUAL and MRPI
You will need to install KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher) and MRPI (MobileRead Package Installer) to run homebrew on your Kindle.

    
        Previous Step
        
        Next Step
    
    
        
            Download MRPI
            
                MRPI
                This version of MRPI is provided by Marek
            
        
        
            Download the correct KUAL version
            
                Kual (Coplate) - For Kindles newer than the K5 (any kindle released after 2012)
                The above version of KUAL is provided by HackerDude
                
                KUAL - For legacy devices
            
        
        
            Extracting MRPI
            
            Extract the contents of the MRPI tar file you downloaded, and copy the extensions and mrpackages folders to your Kindle
            
            
            
        
        
            Extracting/Copying KUAL
            
                If you downloaded KUAL for legacy devices, extract the .tar.xz file you downloaded to get the UpdateKUALBooklet_install.bin file
                The above step does not apply if you downloaded KUAL (Coplate)
                
                Now, find the UpdateKUALBooklet_install.bin file and copy it to your Kindle's mrpackages folder
                
                
            
        
        
            Eject and unplug your Kindle
            
                
            
        
        
            Running MRPI
            
                On your Kindle, type ;log mrpi into the search bar and hit enter
                
                
            
        
        
            Done
            
                Now wait whilst KUAL is installed, your Kindle screen turns white and shows some icons, after a while you will be returned to your library and see a KUAL book appear in it.
                If you see a "Application Error" dialog, you can close it without worry - this is normal behaviour on some modern Kindles
                
                
            
            
    
    
        Previous Step
        
        Next Step
    

new Guide("guide", "../disable-ota", "Disabling OTA Updates");
Troubleshooting
- The installation of UpdateKUALBooklethotfix_install.bin may fail if there is not enough free space on your Kindle. If you are using the "fill storage" method to block updates, make sure to free up some space before proceeding with these steps.
- Verify the location of all the folders and files on the Kindle
- Try copying the UpdateKUALBooklethotfix_install.bin file to the root of your Kindle when connected to your PC, and then go to Settings > Update Your Kindle, then resume from step 5

            Alternative Download Method
            
                
                    Firmware >=5.16.3:
                        Marek's KOReader Installer (nightly) Download and copy this scriptlet into the /documents folder on your Kindle, run it from your Library and it will automatically download and install KOReader
                    This alternative method might not work for everyone
                
            
        

            Connect your Kindle to your computer
            
                Plug your Kindle into your PC via USB cable
                Wait for your computer to recognize the device
                Make sure your Kindle appears as a storage device on your computer
            
        

            Install KOReader
            
                Unzip the downloaded file
                Copy the extensions and koreader folders to the root directory of your Kindle
                When prompted, confirm to merge or replace existing files
            
        

            Disconnect and Launch
            
                Safely eject and unplug your Kindle
                Open KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher)
                Search for the KOReader menu entry and click on it
                
                KOReader Launch Options
                    When launching KOReader, you may see three options:
                    Start KOReader: The designed way to start KOReader
                    
                    Start KOReader (no framework): Temporarily "kills" the Kindle UI to allocate more resources to KOReader
                    
                    Start KOReader (ASAP): Skips a couple of checks and starts KOReader as soon as possible
                    
                
            
        

            Done
            
                KOReader is now installed on your Kindle!
                We recommend reading the extensive but very helpful guide for KOReader
                
                    KOReader currently does not support USBMS mode (USB transfer) and will only charge the device, if you want to transfer files you must exit KOReader to do so 
                
                
                    If KOReader appears in KUAL but doesn't work when clicked, delete both koreader folders, re-download koreader and make sure you're downloading the right package for your Kindle

===== jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/setting-up-a-hotfix/index.md =====

Setting Up A Hotfix
A hotfix allows your Kindle's jailbreak to persist after updating. There are two different hotfixes and which one you need to install depends on which method you used to jailbreak your Kindle.

If you installed OTARenamer, make sure to uninstall it beforehand or the hotfix will not be detected by the Kindle

    
        Previous Step
        
        Next Step
    
    
        
            Download The Hotfix
            
                Download
                
                Download (Compatibility)

                
                    If scriptlets don't work, please redo these steps using the compatibility hotfix!
                
            
        
        
            Copy The Hotfix
            
                Plug your Kindle into your PC and copy the Updatehotfixuniversal.bin file to it
                
                   If you see any other files on your Kindle ending in .bin, or have a similar name to update.bin.tmp.partial, you must delete them for the hotfix to work.  Remember to enable Airplane mode to prevent any automatic updates from downloading
                
                
            
        
        
            Install The Hotfix
            
                Eject the Kindle and unplug it, then open settings, click on the three dots, and select Update Your Kindle
                
                
            
        
        
            Confirming Hotfix Install
            
                If asked, select Update. You can expect this to install the hotfix, as an update.
                
                
            
        
        
            Running the hotfix
            
                Once the hotfix has installed, you'll need to run it.
                Run the hotfix by selecting the Run Hotfix booklet in your library.
                Once the hotfix is done running, you can install KUAL and MRPI
                You will need to run the hotfix booklet after every OTA update

Troubleshooting
Hotfix Won't Install
There is a good chance that after installing an older version of Hotfix you disabled OTA updates, meaning the Hotfix update file will be ignored!

Follow these steps to update the Hotfix:
1. Activate airplane mode
2. Enable OTA update (KUAL -> Rename OTA binaries -> Restore)
3. Follow the Hotfix installation instructions above
4. Disable OTA update (KUAL -> Rename OTA binaries -> Rename)

===== jailbreaking/prevent-auto-update.md =====

Preventing Automatic Updates by Filling Kindle Storage
Why Fill the Kindle's Storage?

Kindle devices can automatically download and install firmware updates when they have enough free storage space. These updates can block jailbreaking methods. Automatic updates may occur when:

- You open the Kindle Store.
- You register your Kindle to an Amazon account.
- The device is connected to Wi-Fi, even briefly.
- The Kindle is rebooted while connected to the internet.

Filling the Kindle's storage (leaving only 50-200 MB free) prevents the device from downloading and installing updates, as the update process requires more free space.
How to Fill the Kindle's Storage
Delete update-whatever.bin OR update.partial.bin, and turn on Airplane Mode!

You can use a simple script to fill your Kindle's storage with dummy files, leaving only a small amount of free space. This script is available in the Kindle-Filler-Disk GitHub repository (https://github.com/bastianmarin/Kindle-Filler-Disk/) along with other useful scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
The script will not work on 11th gen Kindles and newer because these devices use MTP to connect to computers
If this is your situation, you have two options:
1. Delete any stray files ending in .bin, or have a similar name to update.bin.tmp.partial manually at every step of the Jailbreak guide
2. Manually fill your Kindle. Download the Filler files (https://github.com/bastianmarin/Kindle-Filler-Disk/tree/main/MTP/) that match your Kindle's storage from the link below. Extract the files, then move them to the root of your Kindle (you can also save them on a separate folder). After doing so, make sure to leave only 50–200 MB of free space

    
        Previous Step
        
        Next Step
    
    
        
            1. Put Your Kindle in Airplane Mode
            
                Turn on Airplane mode on your Kindle
                
            
        
        
            2. Connect Your Kindle to Your Computer via USB
            
                Use a USB cable to connect your Kindle to your computer.
                
                Wait for the Kindle to appear as a USB drive.
            
        
        
            3. Download the Disk Filler Script
            
                Go to the Kindle-Filler-Disk GitHub repository.
                
                Download the appropriate script for your operating system:
                
                    Windows: Filler.ps1
                    macOS/Linux: Filler.sh
                
            
        
        
            4. Move the Script to Your Kindle
            
                Copy the downloaded script file to the root directory of your Kindle (the main folder you see when you open the Kindle as a USB drive).
                
                Windows: Filler.ps1
                macOS/Linux: Filler.sh
            
        
          
              5. Run the Script
              
                
                    Windows:
                    Open File Explorer and navigate to your Kindle drive.
                    Right-click Filler.ps1 and select Run with PowerShell.
                    If you see an execution policy error, open PowerShell in the Kindle drive and run:
                    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Filler.ps1
                
                
                    macOS/Linux:
                    Open a terminal in the Kindle drive where Filler.sh is located.
                    Make it executable if needed:
                    chmod +x Filler.sh
                    Run the script:
                    ./Filler.sh
                
                
                   
            
        
            6. Safely Disconnect and Verify Storage
            
                Eject your Kindle from your computer.
                On your Kindle, go to Settings &gt; Device Options &gt; Device Info (or similar).
                Check that the available storage is 20 MB or less.
                
            
        
        
            7. Register Your Kindle
            
                With storage nearly full, connect to Wi-Fi and register your Kindle to your Amazon account. The device will not be able to download updates due to lack of space.
            
        
        
            8. Enable Airplane Mode Again
            
                Immediately after registration, enable Airplane Mode to prevent any update attempts.
                Proceed with the next jailbreak steps (such as WinterBreak).
                
                    Important Note: After filling your Kindle's storage, check its contents in the main folder (root directory) and delete any files ending with .bin or named update.bin.tmp.partial. These files are automatic update attempts by the Kindle and should be removed to prevent the device from trying to install an update when you free up space.

After Jailbreak: Freeing Up Space

Once you have completed the jailbreak process, you can safely delete the filldisk folder to recover storage space. You may also remove only some of the files if you want to keep the disk nearly full for a while longer.

- Windows:  
  Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder containing filldisk. Delete the filldisk folder, or remove individual files inside it.

- Linux / macOS:  
  Open a terminal in the folder containing filldisk and run:
  ``sh
  rm -rf filldisk
  ``
  Or remove individual files as needed.

This will restore your available disk space.

Recovering From A Reset
If you factory reset your Kindle to a jailbroken state without first disabling renametobin (the Restore option), then your Kindle may be in a broken state, to fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Follow the MRPI installation instructions (./post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/)
2. Follow the Disable OTA instructions (./post-jailbreak/disable-ota.html)
3. Instead of choosing the Rename option, use the Restore option

If you come from an un-jailbreak attempt, you can also force an update by copying the firmware update file to your Kindle and, while still plugged in, hold down the power button until it restarts.

Kindle Apps & Services
The Kindle has many apps/services which communicated via LIPC, which is similar to dbus in many respsects.

LIPC values are wrapped in square brackets ([]), these should be excluded when writing to a LIPC entry

This entire section is a WIP and is incomplete
How to use
LIPC can be interacted with through the command line as so:
~~~bash
lipc-set-prop    # Set a property value

lipc-set-prop com.lab126.powerd preventScreenSaver 1 # Disable screensaver
lipc-set-prop com.lab126.appmgrd start app://com.lab126.booklet.home # Open the home "app"

lipc-get-prop   # Get a property value

lipc-get-prop com.lab126.btfd isBtchRunning # Check if BTch is running
~~~
Identifying what process owns a service
To get the pid of the process that owns/registered a service, the following command can be used (where  is the name of the service, such as com.lab126.btService):
~~~bash
dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus / org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID string: # Longer Command

gdbus call -y -d org.freedesktop.DBus -o / -m org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID  # Slightly Shorter Command
~~~
Then, you can use ps -p  to get the name of the process, or use ps u -p  to get the full process command line.
List of apps/services
The following list was obtained via the following command run on the Kindle:
~~~bash
lipc-probe -a -v
~~~

Awesome Window Manager
As mentioned in the gtk-tutorial (../gtk-tutorial/), the Kindle uses the Awesome Window Manager with some tweaks, this means that every window must have a title which follows a specific format.

For example, the Kindle store has a window title of:

L:AN:applicationPC:TSID:com.lab126.store

Window titles are actually a key-value store, seperated by an  character, this means the above title, would translate roughly to pseudo-JSON as:

{
    "L":"A",
    "N":"application",
    "PC":"TS",
    "ID":"com.lab126.store"
}

Below is a list of every key and what it's role is:
[L]ayer
The L flag is what layer the window should display on, it can be one of 5 values:

| Value | Description               |
|-------|---------------------------|
| A   | The APP layer           |
| C   | The CHROME layer        |
| D   | The DIALOG layer        |
| KB  | The KB (keyboard) layer |
| SS  | The SCREENSAVER layer   |

Layers are displayed from top to bottom, with applications on the SCREENSAVER layer being above applications on the APP layer.

Generally you will only be using the A and D layer values.
[N]ame
lab126 internally refers to this as the "name/role" of the window, in reality it only represents the role of the window, and should be one of the listed values:

| Value          | Description                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| application  | For use with the A layer, application windows                                                  |
| dialog       | For use with the D layer, dialog windows                                                       |
| titlebar     | For backwards compatability,                                                                     |
| tiledBottom  | [SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION - lab126.applicationlayer.lua:255]                           |
| searchResult | For use with the C layer, seemingly used for search result displays, acts as a modified dialog |
| pillowAlert  | An alert created by Pillow, for use with the D layer, blocks the home button                   |
| titleBar     |                                                                                                  |
| footerBar    |                                                                                                  |
| topBar       | Seemingly used for custom search bar apps (use with BARTYPE parameter)                         |
| mediaBar     |                                                                                                  |
| bottomBar    | REDUNDANT - use topBar role with BARTYPE of B                                              |
| appToolBar   | REDUNDANT - use topBar role with BARTYPE of A                                              |
| keyboard     | Used by the Kindle's keyboard                                                                    |
| keyboardExt  |                                                                                                  |
| activeSS     |                                                                                                  |
| screenSaver  |                                                                                                  |
| searchBar    | Used by the Kindle's top bar                                                                     |

You will generally only use application and dialog for this, in conjunction with the A and D layers
[PC] (Persistent Chrome)

Used by the window manager to determine how to handle displaying chrome elements on the Kindle such as the top bar and "search bar"
It's value is any combination of the following:

| Value | Description                                                                                         | Example                        |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| T   | Show the Kindle top bar/status bar on modern firmware                                               | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/T.png] |
| S   | Shows the "search bar"                                                                              | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/S.png] |
| B   | Shows the legacy bottom bar                                                                         | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/B.png] |
| N   | Show no bars (same as if PC was ommited entirely)                                                 | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/N.png] |

Examples of combining multiple PC values:

| Value | Image                            |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| TS  | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/TS.png]  |
| TSB | [Image: ./images/pcexamples/TSB.png] |

Window resizing appears to be broken in TSB, it is only shown for illustrative purposes and shouldn't be used
[ID] (Identifier)
This is a simple string giving the identifier of the app, it's value can be anything not containing an underscore (as that is used as a delimiter) and it usually takes an app ID in a format similar to com.lab126.reader (reverse domain name)

Note that the value blankBackground is reserved, it's purpose is currently unknown but it makes an app invalid
[BARTYPE]
BARTYPE is used with thetopBar role type, it describes the bar's positioning and takes one of the following values:

| Value | Description                                                                                         |

| B   | Bottom bar type -  "added for kpp chrome footer" - It behaves like top bars in terms of persistence |
| A   | Application bar type - Secondary bar for application specific tools                                 |
[O]rientation - Supported App Orientations
Sets the application's orientation mask for supported orientations, can be any combination of 4 values (IE: ULR or UDLR):

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| U   | Up          |
| D   | Down        |
| L   | Left        |
| R   | Right       |
[HIDE]
A flag that can be set to hide the window, the title can be updated without it to show the window

IE:

L:AN:applicationHIDEID:org.kindlemodding.hiddenwindow

Note that this flag can take an optional value of background which means this window does not take focus. (actual purpose unknown)
[RC] - Rounded Corners
For use with dialogs, can be used to set rounded corners on a dialog, it can be used as a flag or given an integer value representing the corner radius in pixels of all the corners.

It can also be given the value custom, where any combination of the following 4 keys can be used to set a corner radius for the window:
- RCTL
- RCTR
- RCBL
- RCBR

Example, setting rounded corners only on the top-left and top-right corners to the default rounded corner radius:

RC:customRCTLRCTR
[M]odality
Used specifically for dialogs, if this flag is present, it dictates the dialog is a modal.
It can have an optional value of dismissible, ie:

L:AN:applicationM:dismissableID:org.kindlemodding.hiddenwindow
[RKB] - Require KeyBoard
Used specifically for dialogs that require the keyboard, this positions the dialog so that it does not clip with the spawned keyboard.
It can seemingly take a numeric value of unknown purpose.
[PALMR] - Palm Rejection
Purpose unknown - only used in conjunction with M:dismissable, seemingly related to palm rejection on dismissal

GTK Tutorial
This section is a step-by-step guide on creating a native Kindle app with a gui using GTK+-2.0, C++ and the Meson build system.

It is assumed that you already have basic knowledge of C++ before following this guide.

===== kindle-dev/gtk-tutorial/kindle-considerations.md =====

Kindle Considerations
There are some important things to consider when writing GUI-based applications on the Kindle
Window Title
See: Awesome Window Manager

===== kindle-dev/gtk-tutorial/prerequisites.md =====

Prerequisites
You will need to be running a Linux operating system or WSL/msys2 under Windows
MacOS is untested but may work

You will need a jailbroken Kindle and you will need to know what firmware your Kindle is running on.

You will also need to compile a toolchain targetting your device, the details of which are explained further on this page.

You will also need the following packages installed on your system for the toolchain:
- git
- ncurses
- gperf
- help2man
- bison
- texinfo
- flex
- gawk
- unzip
- wget

As well as curl and sed installed for the SDK

And specifically for this tutorial:
- meson
- gtk2 (with development headers)
- compilation tools
Installing The Required Packages
For Arch Linux
For the toolchain
sudo pacman -S base-devel curl git gperf help2man unzip wget
For the SDK
sudo pacman -S curl sed libarchive nettle
For this tutorial
sudo pacman -S meson gtk2
For Debian/Ubuntu
For the toolchain
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake bison flex gawk libtool libtool-bin libncurses-dev curl file git gperf help2man texinfo unzip wget
For the sdk
sudo apt-get install curl sed libarchive-dev nettle-dev
For this tutorial
sudo apt-get install meson gtk2.0 libgtk2.0-dev
Building The Toolchain

If you don't want to build the toolchain yourself or if you encounter difficulties in building it, use the pre-built release (https://github.com/koreader/koxtoolchain/releases/latest)
1. Clone the toolchain

git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/koreader/koxtoolchain.git
2. Build the toolchain for your device

cd koxtoolchain
chmod +x ./gen-tc.sh
./gen-tc.sh 

Where target should be replaced as follows:

|     TC    |              Supported Devices              |               Target             |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|   kindle  |             Kindle 2, DX, DXg, 3            | [not supported by this tutorial] |
|  kindle5  |             Kindle 4, Touch, PW1            | [not supported by this tutorial] |
| kindlepw2 | Kindle PW2 & everything since on FW = 5.16.3         |              kindlehf            |

If you want to support multiple Kindles, you can compile multiple toolchain targets just by running ./gen-tc.sh  and the new toolchain be added to your ~/x-tools directory

Compilation usually takes around 30-minutes per target on most PCs
Setting up the SDK

The KMC Kindle SDK augments your existing koxtoolchain installation by providing headers and library files used with the Kindle.
1. Clone the SDK

git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/KindleModding/kindle-sdk.git
2. Install the SDK for your target

cd kindle-sdk
chmod +x ./gen-sdk.sh
./gen-sdk.sh 

Where  is the same as the toolchain you want to install the SDK for.

 [Image: ./images/sdkinstall.png]
Once the SDK has finished installing itself, make a note of the path it returns to the meson-crosscompile.txt file, this will be important later!

===== kindle-dev/gtk-tutorial/setting-up.md =====

Setting Up The Project
Create a new git repository in a safe location, this will be where we write the code for our app
Setting up the Meson project
Creating the meson.options file
Create a file called meson.options and copy the following to it:

option('kindlerootdir', type : 'string', value: '', description: 'The path to the Kindle\'s mounted rootfs (for linking libraries)')

The meson.options (https://mesonbuild.com/Build-options.html) file tells Meson what parameters a project uses for configuration and compilation, in our case we only need the kindlerootdir option so we can set it to our Kindle's root directory in a later step.
Creating the meson.build file
The meson.build file specifies how our project is configured and compiled.
Create a meson.build file and copy the following to it:

project('examplegtkapplication', 'cpp', version: 'v1.0.0', defaultoptions: ['cppstd=c++17'], mesonversion: '>=1.1')
Define dependencies we want
gtkdep = dependency('gtk+-2.0')
Project definition
sources = files(
    './src/main.cpp'
)

includedirs = includedirectories(
  './src/include/'
)

executable('examplegtkapplication', sources, includedirectories: includedirs, dependencies: [gtkdep], cppargs: '-static-libstdc++', linkargs: '-static-libstdc++')

Note how we statically link the C++ standard library! Koxtoolchain ships with a GCC version newer than the Kindle technically supports, but this is fine so long as we statically link the standard library.

Your overall file structure should now look something like this:

.
├── meson.build
└── meson.options

1 directory, 2 files
Creating our source files
Now create a file called main.cpp and a folder called include under the src/ folder, your overall file structure should look something like:

.
├── meson.build
├── meson.options
└── src
    ├── include
    └── main.cpp

3 directories, 3 files

Now in main.cpp, copy the following code:
include 

int main(int argc, char argv[]) {
  GtkWidget window;
    
  gtkinit (&argc, &argv);
  
  window = gtkwindownew(GTKWINDOWTOPLEVEL);
  gtkwindowsettitle(GTKWINDOW(window), "L:AN:applicationID:org.kindlemodding.example-gtk-applicationPC:T");

  gsignalconnect(window, "destroy", GCALLBACK(gtkmainquit), NULL);

  gtkwidgetshow(window);
  
  gtkmain();

  return 0;
}
Testing compilation
Now we will use meson to make sure we can actually compile our code for both our computer and our target

Configure the Meson project for your computer as so:

meson setup builddir

Now we can try to compile our program

meson compile -C builddir

If you run the program on your computer, you should see an empty GTK window:
 [Image: ./images/firstwindow.png]
Testing Cross-Compilation
Now we can compile a version that can run on the Kindle itself:

meson setup --cross-file  builddir

Where your target is the same as before and  is substituted from the path the SDK installer gave you earlier.

Once it is finished setting up, you can compile it just as you did before:

meson compile -C builddir

If all the above steps work, then you have succesfully compiled your first application for the Kindle.

===== kindle-dev/index.md =====

Kindle Development
As mentioned in Kindle OS (/kindle-os/), the Kindle runs Linux, this means that you can develop your own applications for it, which run natively on the Kindle.

This section of the wiki is primarily aimed towards native development with C/C++ via the Meson Build System

===== kindle-dev/kindle-sdk.md =====

Kindle SDK

The Kindle SDK is an unofficial SDK developed by KMC.  
It supplants an existing koxtoolchain installation with libraries and pkg-config support.  
It is designed to be used with Meson.
Installation
Once koxtoolchain is installed, the SDK can be installed on top of it as such:
1. Clone the SDK

git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/KindleModding/kindle-sdk.git
2. Install the SDK for your target

cd kindle-sdk
chmod +x ./gen-sdk.sh
./gen-sdk.sh 

Where  is the same as the toolchain you want to install the SDK for.  

|     TC    |              Supported Devices              |               Target             |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|   kindle  |             Kindle 2, DX, DXg, 3            | [not supported by this tutorial] |
|  kindle5  |             Kindle 4, Touch, PW1            | [not supported by this tutorial] |
| kindlepw2 | Kindle PW2 & everything since on FW = 5.16.3         |              kindlehf            |
Usage
The toolchain is designed to be used with Meson in the following manner:  

meson setup --cross-file  builddir_

(note that the crosscompile file path is outputted when the sdk installer is run, it will typically be under ~/x-tools//meson-crosscompile.txt)
Additional information
The SDK works by downloading the target firmware from Amazon, copying the libraries into the toolchain's sysroot and setting up .pc files for pkgconfig on supported libraries

===== kindle-dev/scriptlets.md =====

Scriptlets
As part of the Universal Hotfix released with Winterbreak, a method of running programs was introduced: Scriptlets  

Scriptlets are handled by the SHIntegration (https://github.com/KindleModding/shintegration).  
Essentially, any .sh file in the Kindle's documents folder (/mnt/us/documents) will be indexed as though it were a book and get added to the library.  
From here, it can be clicked on to run it.  
Scriptlet Metadata
How these Scriptlets appear can be customised in the file itself by adding specific lines to the start of the file:
!/bin/sh
Name: Test Script
Author: Hackerdude

echo "Hello, World!"

When this Scriptlet is added to a Kindle, it will appear in the library with the name of Test Script and the author of Hackerdude.
Icons
Scriptlets can be given an Icon via the # Icon:  flag, the value can either be an absolute path to the image file, or a base64 encoded image as shown:  
!/bin/sh
Name: KoReader
Author: Hackerdude

Note that some converters use the wrong filetype when generating the base64 string, ensure the filetype matches the actual data
Hooks
The # UseHooks flag allows Scriptlets to have functions that are called when certain events happen to the Scriptlet, as opposed to the entire script being called once when it is ran:  
!/bin/sh
Name: Test For Evnets
Author: HackerDude
UseHooks

oninstall() {
    echo "oninstall called!" >> /mnt/us/test.log
}

onremove() {
    echo "onremove called!" >> /mnt/us/test.log
}

onrun() {
    echo "onrun called!" >> /mnt/us/test.log
}
DontUseFbink
By default, the script's stdout and stderr are both piped to FBink to display on the Kindle, if you do not want this behaviour, then add the # DontUseFBInk flag to your script as such:  
!/bin/sh
Name: Silent Script
Author: HackerDude
DontUseFBInk

echo "A user won't see this"
Examples
For more Scriptlet examples or to share your own, please check the scriptlets channel in the Kindle Modding Community Discord server (https://dsc.gg/kindle-modding).

===== kindle-os/Java/index.md =====

Java
Prior to the "Reactification" of the Kindle frontend, Kindles used to primarily use Java for the frontend and some middleware.

Modern firmwares, however, utilise significantly less Java for the frontend, LIPC middleware and backend code, however, still heavily utilises Java.

===== kindle-os/Lua/index.md =====

Lua
The Kindle makes relatively little use of Lua.
Lua is used for the CCAT Store-SQL-Bridge

===== kindle-os/Native/index.md =====

Native
The majority of the Kindle's backend runs on native libraries and executables.

This includes most of LIPC system.

===== kindle-os/React Native/index.md =====

React Native
Modern Kindle firmwares have pivoted to using React Native for the frontend.

React Native code is effectively just native, but the original language it was written in was not C/C++

What this means is that it's significantly easier to develop for, however, as a jailbreak developer, this makes the React Native frontend code significantly harder to reverse engineer compared to older Java frontend code.

Kindle OS
kindleos [Image: ./kindleos.png]

As many Kindle developers are aware, the Kindle's OS is a mess of Java, Javascript, Lua, Native and React Native code.
Due to its complexity, there hasn't been any exhaustive documentation on its working, that is what this section aims to do.

The Kindle runs stripped down Linux with a React Native frontend along with Java backend applications.

Usermode Boot Process
The Kindle uses upstart for its usermode boot process.

Below is a diagram generated from all the Kindle's (PW6) upstart services.

===== mesquito/development/getting-started.md =====

Getting Started
This guide will show you how to setup the correct structure for a Mesquito app.
Introduction
Every Mesquito app needs an identifier. This is basically the same as say, a Java namespace, and follows the following format:
~~~
..
~~~

for example:
~~~
com.bluebotlaboratories.kchess
dev.tesseractcat.sudoku
~~~

This identifier is important as it must be unique to all other apps, hence why the format is as it is. Additionally, identifiers must be lowercase and contain NO symbols.
Creating the folder
You will need to create an empty folder in the apps folder of your Kindle with the same name as your identifier.

Generally speaking, there are 3 main files of importance to be placed in that folder, a manifest (./the-manifest-file.html), a payload and an app icon (./the-manifest-file.html)

For example, the directory structure for kchess is as follows:
~~~
com.bluebotlaboratories.kchess
│   icon.jpg
│   index.html
│   main.css
│   main.js
│   manifest.json
│
└───pieces
        bB.svg
        bK.svg
        bN.svg
        bP.svg
        bQ.svg
        bR.svg
        wB.svg
        wK.svg
        wN.svg
        wP.svg
        wQ.svg
        wR.svg
~~~
You can see the manifest.json file, the index.html payload and the icon.jpg icon. There are also additional files which are used by the app as assets and dependencies.
Finding an icon
The app icon can be almost any image format, however, a resolution of 512x512 is recommended as Mesquito is optimized for square icons.

The Manifest File (./the-manifest-file.html)

===== mesquito/development/index.md =====

Developing For Mesquito
Developing for Mesquito is extremely simple, in fact, almost any webapp can be easily converted into a Mesquito-compatible one, all it needs is an icon and a manifest (./the-manifest-file.html) file
Limitations
As it is overriding the store WAF, Mesquito can only access the com.lab126.pillow, com.lab126.chromebar and com.lab126.readnow LIPC services via the messaging (../../wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/kindle-messaging.html) object. Additionally, as it is running on a Kindle, it has the same featureset as Safari 5, you can use the caniuse.com (https://caniuse.com/) (or Can Mesquite Use? (https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/polish-penguin-dev/Illusion/blob/main/Mesquite/Can-Mesquite-Use.html)) site to determine if you can use certain web features on the Kindle.

Mesquito also includes its own polyfill, and whilst the polyfill works extremely well, there are some things that can't be replaced by a polyfill, for this reason the following features do not work:
- Arrow Functions (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrowfunctions)
- Default Parameters (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Defaultparameters)

(The reason for this is that a polyfill can add modern web APIs to your application, it does not add modern language features - see Babel/SWC).

A fix for the LIPC limitation is being worked on.

Getting Started (./getting-started.html)

===== mesquito/development/the-manifest-file.md =====

The Manifest File
The manifest file holds all the information which Mesquito uses to identify the app, it should follow the following format:

~~~json
{
  "minVersion": 1,
  "manifestVersion": 2,
  "appVersion": "v0.1.0",
  "waf": false,
  "id": "com.bluebotlaboratories.kchess",
  "name": "KChess",
  "author": "Bluebotlaboratories",
  "description": "Chess on a Kindle!",
  "repo": "https://github.com/KindleModding/KWebBrew",
  "icon": "icon.jpg",

The Mesquito SDK (./the-mesquito-sdk.html)

===== mesquito/development/the-mesquito-sdk.md =====

Mesquito SDK
All apps that use waf: true MUST have the following lines in their head:
~~~html

~~~

The polyfill.min.js allows you to use somewhat modern web features in your app. Whilst the sdk.js allows you to utilise Mesquito's SDK and access special Kindle JS functions.
It is also important to set a title for your app in HTML so that it appears in the title bar.
If your app does not use Mesquito-specific features, it is recommented you instead use KWebBrew's files so that the app can function on both Mesquito and KWebBrew (as Mesquito is backwards-compatible with KWebBrew apps)
Simply add the following to your head instead:
~~~html

~~~
SDK Functionality
The Mesquito SDK exposes the kindle object so that it can be invoked directly in scripts as so:
~~~js
kindle.appmgr.start("com.lab126.booklet.home"); // "launches" the home app (just goes home)
~~~

Additionally, the Mesquito SDK exposes some useful functions:
fetchFile
~~~js
fetchFile(url, timeout=2000, fixKindleFormatting=true)
~~~
This function returns the contents of a file as a string given a url, such as file:///mnt/us/apps/com.bluebotlaboratories.kchess/manifest.json.
It should, in theory, work an all text-based filetypes, but will NOT work on binary formats.

| Parameter           | Default Value | Description                                                                                    |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| url                 |               | The URL of the file to obtain                                                                  |
| timeout             | 2000          | The amount of time to wait until deleting the iframe from DOM                                  |
| fixKindleFormatting | true          | Needed for local files, whether to fix the formatting the Kindle applies to local files or not |
getDirectory
~~~js
getDirectory(location)
~~~
This function is similar to fetchFile and works in almost the same way. Except it fetches the contents of a directory as an object. The location parameter, despite its name, is just a url, ie: file:///mnt/us/ (despite being a url, it will only work with local folders)

Example Output:
~~~json
[
    {
        "name": "documents",
        "path": "file:///mnt/us/documents/"
    },
    {
        "name": "apps",
        "path": "file:///mnt/us/apps/"
    },
    {
        "name": "mesquito",
        "path": "file:///mnt/us/mesquito/"
    },
    {
        "name": "log.txt",
        "path": "file:///mnt/us/log.txt"
    }
]
~~~

| Parameter | Default Value | Description                   |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| location  |               | The URL of the folder to list |
getQueryData
~~~js
getQueryData()
~~~

Taking no arguments, it returns an object representing the GET parameters of the current location.
IE, the location:
~~~
file:///mnt/us/mesquito/index.html?entrypoint=hello&launch=false
~~~

would return:
~~~json
{
    "entrypoint": "hello",
    "launch": "false"
}
~~~
joinPaths
~~~js
joinPaths(path1, path2)
~~~

Given two paths, joins them together.

IE: Given /test/ and ./hello
~~~
/test/hello
~~~

| Parameter | Default Value | Description             |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| path1     |               | The first path to join  |
| path2     |               | The second path to join |
window.mesquito
The window.mesquito object holds useful helper functions to the kindle API
window.mesquito.updateNavigation
~~~js
window.mesquito.updateNavigation()
~~~

This reloads the navbar, updating its contents, useful when updating the available menuItems
window.mesquito.menuItems
~~~js
window.mesquito.menuItems = [
    {
        id: "CHESSRELOAD",
        state: "enabled",
        label: "Reload Game"
    },
    {
        id: "DIVIDEZERO",
        state: "enabled",
        label: "Divide By Zero"
    }
]
~~~

This serves as an object which allows your app to add custom menu items to the Kindle's menu (under the three dots).

As mentioned earlier, window.mesquito.updateNavigation() must be called to update the actual state of the navbar.
window.mesquito.onKindleButton
~~~js
window.mesquito.onKindleButton = function(buttonType, buttonID) {
    console.log(buttonType);
    console.log(buttonID);
}
~~~

This is a function which can be overriden by your app to handle menu item button presses. the buttonID parameter will be equal to whatever id you set the button to, ie: DIVIDEZERO or CHESSRELOAD. The buttonType parameter is used to differenciate between menu buttons (systemMenuItemSelected) and navbar buttons (TBA) and can be ignored.

===== mesquito/development/tutorial.md =====

Your First App
Assuming you have read all the other sections, this tutorial will go over how you can create your own functioning Mesquito WAF.
Creating the folder
Either on a safe place in your PC or in the apps/ folder of your Kindle, create a new folder, call it com.mesquito.firstapptutorial, this will store our app data
Creating the manifest file
Within that folder, create a manifest.json as so:
~~~json
{
  "minVersion": 2,
  "manifestVersion": 2,
  "appVersion": "v1.0.0",
  "waf": true,
  "id": "com.mesquito.firstapptutorial",
  "name": "My First App!",
  "author": "tutorial",
  "description": "Tutorial App",
  "repo": "https://example.com",
  "icon": "icon.png",
  "entrypoint": "index.html"
}
~~~

The manifest file tells Mesquito all the information it needs to load the app.
Creating the index.html file
As hinted by the payload key of the manifest, the app will need an index.html file to work with, simply create one in the folder and insert the following contents:
~~~html

  
  
  

  
  

  My First APP

  My First Mesquito App!

  Flip Orientation

~~~
This will display a simple webpage but won't do anything itself, that's because we still need to add some code!
Adding some Javascript
Create a new file, call it main.js, this will store all the code for the app, you can insert the following contents:
~~~js
var flipped = false;

function buttonClick() {
    if (flipped) {
        kindle.device.setOrientation("portraitUp");
        flipped = false;
    } else {
        kindle.device.setOrientation("portraitDown");
        flipped = true;
    }
}
~~~
This code will use the setOrientation (../../wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/kindle-device.html#kindledevicesetorientation) function to flip the orientation of the screen at the press of the button.
Adding some style
The app would still look quite basic at this stage, so we need to give it some style! Simply create a file called main.css and insert the following content:
~~~css
button {
  border-radius: 15px;
}
~~~

You should NEVER use relative units when developing for a Kindle, as pixel units are more consistent accross models
Testing it out
If you haven't already, copy the com.mesquito.firstapptutorial folder to your apps folder, reload Mesquito by clicking on the three dots and then Home, and open your app:

Next steps
You saw how we can use the WAF API within a Mesquito app to affect the device to an extent, feel free to read the kindle object (../../wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/) for more information!

===== mesquito/index.md =====

Mesquito
Mesquito is a simple WAF loader designed to replace the Kindle store on Kindles. Mesquito is extremely simple to install and runs on all firmwares below 5.18.
Installation
1. Download the latest release (https://github.com/KindleModding/Mesquito/releases/latest)
2. Place your Kindle into airplane mode
3. Plug your Kindle into your PC
4. Extract the zip file you downloaded to the root of your Kindle
5. Replace any files if prompted
6. Reboot your Kindle
7. Open the Kindle Store
8. When prompted, turn on WiFi
9. Done!

Make sure you turn on Airplane mode to stop the Kindle getting an OTA update that could break Mesquito!
Post-Installation
A collection of Mesquito apps are available here (https://github.com/KindleModding/KindleModding-Apps)
Simply download the latest release (https://github.com/KindleModding/Mesquito/releases/latest) and copy the apps you want to the apps folder on your Kindle and re-load Mesquito by clicking on the 3 dots > Home

WAFs & Mesquite
WAFs are Kindle "applications", which similar to Mesquito or KWebBrew applications, are really just webapps in fancy wrappers.

WAFs should be placed in /opt/var/local/mesquite, in its own folder, such as:
~~~
/opt/var/local/mesquite/store
~~~

Additionally, they should be declared in /opt/var/local/appreg.db so they are launchable.

For example, lets examine the Kindle store's folder structure:
~~~
/opt/var/local/mesquite/store/
│   config.xml
│   configbellatrix.xml
│   configduet.xml
│   configheisenberg.xml

Most of the files are just dependencies used by the store, lets filter it down to whats interesting to us:
~~~

        privateCookies
        strings.js
~~~

All WAFs have a config.xml file, which gives the Kindle the metadata which it needs to launch the WAF.

Additionally, notice the strings folder, whilst not required, Amazon has a standardized localisation method of using strings.js files in strings folders for each locale (ie: the locales folder).

More information on these is available in the sub-pages of this section.

===== wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/enums.md =====

Enums

===== wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/index.md =====

The Kindle Object
All WAFs have a window.kindle object available to them. This serves as a bridge between the Javascript and the Kindle's system.
There are many APIs available, which can be configured via the Features (../understanding-config-xml.html#features) section of the config.xml file of a WAF.

This section aims to document every API available via the window.kindle object

The kindle object also has the following properties:

| Name    | Value   | Description                                           |
|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| version | 1     | An int which appears to store the version of the API? |
Secret Dev Stuff
In the local-development version (the Kindle object is spoofed for local development), the following interesting properties also exist, isMock which is 1 and extensions which is {}

===== wafs-and-mesquite/the-kindle-object/kindle-chrome.md =====

kindle.chrome
Functions specific to the titlebar and dialog interfaces.

Has the following parameters:

| Name                    | Value | Dscription                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| isDecanterChromeEnabled | true  | A boolean describing whether or not "decanter chrome" is enabled. Seemingly related to firmware version as new firmwares have whatever "decanter chrome" is. |

This page is a WIP and should be considered incomplete
kindle.chrome.setTitleBar
~~~js
kindle.chrome.setTitleBar(centerText, leftText)
~~~
Seemingly accepts 2 string arguments, purpose is unknown, possibly deprecated in modern Kindle firmware versions

DO NOT use this in Mesquite applications, that is what the SDK (../../mesquito/development/the-mesquito-sdk.html) is for
kindle.chrome.createHeader
~~~js
kindle.chrome.createHeader(uri, height, tiled)
~~~
Seemingly accepts a string, integer and boolean parameter for uri, height and tiled respectively. Function is unknown.
kindle.chrome.createDialog
~~~js
kindle.chrome.createDialog(uri, width, height, modal)
~~~
Creates a dialog visible on the Kindle. Exact usage is currently unknown.

| modal  | Boolean | Exact usage unknown, usually seems to be set to true                 |
kindle.chrome.setSpinnerState
~~~js
kindle.chrome.setSpinnerState(state, timeout, delay)
~~~
Used to indicate progress via a spinner in the title bar.

| Name    | Type    | Dscription                                                                                            |
|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

timeout and delay are still needed even if state is stop as JSObjectChrome::setSpinnerState expects three arguments despite the fact that they are ignored when state is stop.

The following section refers to content windows these are not currently fully understood, continue with caution.
kindle.chrome.createContentWindow
~~~js
kindle.chrome.createContentWindow(uri)

Todo Document Format
~~~xml

    1
    
        
    

~~~

This XML format dictates the TODO action via the type and action parameters, this is known as the contentId.
The contentId is in the format action.type, so in this case, it would be REFRESH.WISHLIST. All TODO items have a priority and a key attribute, however, all other attributes are arbritary and are simply passed to the handler.
Attributes

| Name     | Value    | Dscription                                                                                             |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| priority | 1        | An integer which dictates the priority of a TODO item                                                  |
| type     | WISHLIST | What type of action to perform                                                                         |
| action   | REFRESH  | The action to perform                                                                                  |
| key      | DUMMY    | A string used to uniquely identify the TODO item, can also be used by the handler or simply be "DUMMY" |

A list of valid todo documents will be made in the future, more research is required.

~~~

Yes, it's quite complex, let's break it down:
The header
~~~xml

~~~
This section is quite simple, it tells the Kindle the id of the WAF (com.lab126.store) and the viewmode of the WAF (currently unknown other than application)

The id, like Mesquito IDs, can be any unique "Java-like namespace".
Name/Description
~~~xml
Kindle Store

Kindle-Shop
Amazon Kindle-Shop

Kindle&#12473;&#12488;&#12450;

...
~~~

This section serves to show the name and description of the WAF on the Kindle's UI... somewhere
It supports an xml:lang attribute which allows for localisation. It also allows for the use of unicode characters, as shown
The "Payload"
~~~xml

~~~

This is a single tag which tells the Kindle which file to load when the WAF is loaded. In this case, it'll be the store's index.html file
Permissions
~~~xml

    

~~~

Yes, that spelling mistake is indeed in the firmware

This tag serves to request certain special permissions from the Kindle, below is a list of all known permissions:

| Permission Name   | Description                                                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| local-port-access | Allows the WAF to access localhost (mainly just the DB interface on port 9101) |
| download-allowed  | Allows the WAF to download files to the Kindle's documents folder                |
Network

~~~

This section appears to handle Kindle networking, allowing you to set proxy overrides for a specific WAF, network headers, as well as setting an errorPage for when loads fail.
