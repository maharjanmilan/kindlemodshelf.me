    <h2 class="section-title">Step-by-Step Kindle Jailbreak Instructions (2025)</h2>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <h3>HOW TO JAILBREAK</h3>
      <p>First check your firmware version:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Turn on your Kindle</li>
        <li>Click the 3 dots on the right top hand side</li>
        <li>Click Settings</li>
        <li>Click Device Options</li>
        <li>Device Info</li>
        <li>Check your firmware version</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Jailbreak your Kindle using the appropriate guide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Firmware 5.16.2.1.1 or earlier:</b> Use Legacy jailbreaks<br><a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/Legacy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/Legacy/index.html</a></li>
        <li><b>Firmware 5.16.3 to 5.18.0:</b> Use WinterBreak<br><a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/</a></li>
        <li><b>Firmware 5.18.1 to 5.18.5:</b> Use AdBreak<br><a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/AdBreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/AdBreak/</a></li>
        <li><b>Firmware 5.18.6 and later:</b> Currently has no jailbreak</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Note:</b> I have not included legacy jailbreak methods like KindleBreak or WatchThis or LanguageBreak. Check <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/Legacy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/Legacy/index.html</a> for more info if you have a legacy Kindle.</p>

      <h3>AFTER JAILBREAK</h3>
      <p>Make sure you have installed Block OTA Updates, MRPI, and KUAL from the guide at <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/index.html</a></p>
      <p>This should be integrated with the jailbreaking process, but it is important to make sure!</p>
      <p>Congratulations! You have now freed yourself from the grasp of Amazon!</p>
      <p>But now what?</p>
      <p>Well, <a href="index.html">kindlemodshelf.me</a> is designed for you! It has basically every mod, plugin, and patch that works on Kindle. But that can be a little overwhelming, which is why I have made this guide. Here are what I consider essential when you start jailbreaking.</p>

      <h3>ESSENTIAL MODS</h3>
      <p>Start with installing KindleForge:</p>
      <p><a href="kindleforge.html">kindleforge</a></p>
      <p>KindleForge is an app store for Kindles that allows you to download and install mods directly on your device, without needing to copy files manually.</p>
      <p>Then open KindleForge and install whatever you want. However, to start off with, I would recommend installing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>KOReader</b><br><a href="koreader.html">koreader</a><br>KOReader is a free, open-source eBook reader app designed for e-ink devices. See the official guide on how to use it here: <a href="https://koreader.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://koreader.rocks/</a></li>
        <li><b>KTerm</b> (<a href="kterm.html">kterm</a>)<br>KTerm is the essential terminal emulator for jailbroken Kindle e-readers. Even if you have no idea how to use it, it is a dependency for a lot of other apps.</li>
        <li><b>UpdateBlock Status</b><br>This will give you the peace of mind to make sure that Amazon cannot force remove your Kindle's updates. If it is not blocked, go back to <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/index.html</a></li>
        <li><b>KUAL (otherwise known as PEKI)</b><br><a href="peki.html">peki</a><br>PEKI installs and launches KUAL without MRPI and delivers a polished icon.</li>
        <li><b>Toggle ADs</b><br><a href="disableads.html">disableads</a><br>Allows you to remove ads from your Kindle lock screen for free. Normally, Amazon charges you $20.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>KindleForge is really excellent and I would recommend you check out the other mods it offers, but a lot of them are not on my essential list, like KindleCraft which turns your Kindle into a Minecraft server.</p>

      <h3>OPENING APPS</h3>
      <p>There are two main ways to open apps: as a scriptlet which shows up as a book in your library, or through KUAL.</p>
      <p>Run scriptlets by tapping on them in your library.</p>
      <p>Run apps in KUAL by opening the KUAL scriptlet and then clicking on the app you want to run.</p>
      <p>Manual installation is not that hard. Just follow the step by step guides I am providing.</p>

      <h3>BLOCKING AMAZON</h3>
      <p><a href="blockamazon.html">blockamazon</a></p>
      <p>Amazon tracks literally everything you do even after you are jailbroken. Amazon tracks where you click with millimeter precision, what books you open, how long you are reading, and literally everything you can imagine to make money selling your preferences and serve you ads on Amazon and on your Kindle. This script blocks Amazon tracking, Kindle Store, and UI ads on your Kindle.</p>
      <p>If you want to see Amazon tracking in real time, open KTerm and type in:</p>
      <p><code>tail -F /var/log/messages</code></p>
      <p>After blocking Amazon you will still see cached ads on the UI. CLEAR ADS CACHE script removes them.</p>
      <p><a href="clearadcache.html">clearadcache</a></p>
      <p>You will still see popular reads ads, but these require editing system files which could brick your Kindle. However, if you want to remove the images from the popular books, the commands are available at <a href="index.html">kindlemodshelf.me</a> under OTHER COOL STUFF section.</p>

      <h3>KOREADER MODDING</h3>
      <p>KOReader by default is pretty bland. It does not look nice, and it does not have some features that the original Kindle does.</p>
      <p>One of people's favorite things to do with KOReader is add custom screensavers. See over 1000+ images at <a href="images.html">images</a> and how to install here: <a href="customscreensavers.html">customscreensavers</a></p>
      <p>KOReader also allows the community to create plugins and user patches!</p>
      <p>The first plugin you should install is Project Title!</p>
      <p>Project Title adds a TON of UI features that beautify KOReader! It can be a little bit difficult to install sometimes but just follow the guide carefully.</p>
      <p><a href="projecttitle.html">projecttitle</a></p>
      <p>There are so many other plugins and patches that I cannot exactly list them all here, nor is that the point of this guide. You can go and check out which ones you want to install for yourself at:</p>
      <p><a href="plugins.html">plugins</a></p>
      <p><a href="patches.html">patches</a></p>
      <p>One of my favorite user patches is Page Header which makes your Kindle look like an actual book.</p>
      <p><a href="pageheader.html">pageheader</a></p>

      <h3>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h3>
      <p>There are a ton of games you can play on your Kindle. Play Kindle Wordle or play games inside of a Game Boy emulator. See the games section on <a href="index.html">kindlemodshelf.me</a></p>
      <p>A really great use of your Kindle is as a flashcard app. KAnki is based on the hugely popular Anki which focuses on spaced repetition to memorize flashcards.</p>
      <p><a href="kanki.html">kanki</a></p>
      <p>It is available in the KindleForge app store.</p>
      <p>To easily create and manage your KAnki decks on your Kindle, I made <a href="editor.html">editor</a></p>
      <p>If you love KAnki, also check out Ubens at <a href="https://ubens.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ubens.vercel.app/</a> which was made by the same guy and allows you to have an Anki-like experience that is easy to sync with your Kindle!</p>
