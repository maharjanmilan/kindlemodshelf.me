    <div class="summary">
      Sometimes things go wrong when jailbreaking or messing around. So let's fix it!

      <h2 class="section-title" id="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
          <li>Preferably a PC, but a Mac can work</li>
          <li>Decent technical experience (don't worry, I'll try to make it easy)</li>
          <li>A cable that supports data transfer</li>
          <li><em>Potential experience with soldering and/or disassembling devices</em> <strong>(worst-case scenario)</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <section aria-labelledby="is-it-bricked">
      <h2 class="section-title" id="is-it-bricked">IS IT ACTUALLY BRICKED?</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <p>First, lets figure out if your Kindle is actually bricked</p>
        <ol>
          <li>See if holding down the power button for about 5 seconds pops up a screen thats lets you restart and if it does then do so.</li>
          <li>If it does not or your kindle is still bricked, then hold down the power button for about a minute and it should force restart.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If this still does not work/did not fix your issue, it is safe to say your Kindle is bricked.<br>
        You have a few options now:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wait for the battery to run out <em>(This could take an <strong>extremely</strong> long time)</em> and then plug it in.</li>
          <li>If you are comfortable with doing so, open up your Kindle and unplug the battery. Then just plug it back in.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Unless the physics that apply everywhere else on Earth are suspended in your house, your Kindle has now restarted</p>

      <h2 class="section-title" id="accessing">ACCESSING YOUR KINDLE WITH A COMPUTER</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc">

        <h3>PC Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Grab a data supported USB cable</li>
          <li>Plug in your Kindle to your computer</li>
          <li>If it's not showing up, try waiting a bit or restarting your Kindle</li>
          <li>Once you have access to the Kindle, open the root (where the documents and audible folders are).</li>
          <li>Create a file on the root <strong><em>with no extension</em></strong> called "DO_FACTORY_RESTORE" and restart your Kindle</li>
          <li>Your Kindle should now go back to the initial setup, you are officially unbricked!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Mac Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are on an older Kindle, you should be able to follow the PC instructions. The instructions below are for newer (MTP) Kindles</li>

        </ul>
        <p>If your Kindle is MTP, you will need to install either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/mac?&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=ter000-20&amp;linkId=07f7c7db67889bf36e836471c479526e&amp;la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Send to Kindle App</a> or <a href="https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMTP</a>.<br>
