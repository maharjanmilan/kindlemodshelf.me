AdBreak
is jailbreak released on
24 Sep 2025
for ad-enabled Kindle devices on firmware
5.18.1 → 5.18.5
. It leverages an exploit related to
CVE-2012-3748
. This page gives the essential facts, a compact install checklist, how to enable ads if needed, and key troubleshooting notes.
Read everything before you begin.

Official release & resources

Release at a glance

Release date:
24 Sep 2025

Maintainer:
@hhhhhhhhh

Exploit base:
CVE-2012-3748

Supported firmware:
5.18.1 – 5.18.5 (some micro-patches may block the exploit)

Requires:
Special Offers (ads) active on the lockscreen

Prerequisites

PC + USB cable
(you will copy/replace the device
.assets
folder)

Kindle must be
registered
and not blacklisted

Kindle must display
Special Offers (ads)
on the lockscreen

Device firmware must be in the supported range (see above). If ≤ 5.18.0.2, use WinterBreak instead.

Do not proceed
without verifying the above—especially the presence of ads and correct firmware.

Quick install checklist

Download
the latest AdBreak package from the official release page.

Confirm ads:
keep the Kindle online until ads appear on the lockscreen. If no ads appear, a factory reset can sometimes help (see Troubleshooting).

Enable airplane mode
after ads are visible.

Open lockscreen menu →
View all ads
to confirm multiple Special Offers are listed.

Copy
.assets
– connect Kindle to PC and copy the device's
.assets
folder (backup the original).

Unpack AdBreak
and merge its files into the copied
.assets
folder on your PC.

Run replace helper:

Windows – run
replace.bat

macOS / Linux – run the provided terminal command to place the exploit HTML into matching ad folders (example in the release)

Replace device assets:
delete the original
.assets
on the Kindle and copy the modified folder back.

Trigger exploit:
unplug the Kindle, tap the modified ad, follow prompts; the jailbreak script should run at the final popup.

Backup your original
.assets
folder and any data before modifying anything.

Enable Special Offers (if needed)

If your device shipped without ads you can often re-enable them via your Amazon account:

Amazon →
Manage Your Content and Devices → Preferences → Country/Region
: select a supported region (US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, JP, CN).

Add a matching billing address and a payment method (card required; usually no charge).

Enable
Special Offers
for your device and sync – ads should populate the lockscreen after some time.

Important:
Kindle Scribe and Colorsoft cannot be made ad-enabled and are not compatible with AdBreak.

Troubleshooting & key cautions

Ad removal:
AdBreak does not remove Special Offers. Use separate scripts if you want ads removed after jailbreaking.

Unsupported models:
Scribe & Colorsoft cannot be jailbroken with AdBreak.

Firmware issues:
some 5.18.5 micro-builds (e.g., 5.18.5.0.1) may block the exploit – check community threads for workarounds.

Hidden system folders:
mass-storage Kindles may hide the system folder—follow a device-specific guide to reveal it before replacing
.assets
.

Factory reset:
can force ad downloads but will erase personal data—only use if you understand the consequences.

Always keep backups:
preserve the original
.assets
so you can restore the device if needed.

Exploit contributions from community members (including work attributed to Chris Evans / @scarybeasts)

Helper / install scripts contributed by community maintainers

Summary:
AdBreak is a targeted jailbreak for ad-enabled Kindles on firmware 5.18.1–5.18.5. It requires Special Offers and a PC to replace the device
.assets
. Verify prerequisites, back up originals, and consult community threads for model-specific advice before you proceed.

Kindle Jailbreak FAQ (2025)

← Back to Home

Kindle Jailbreak FAQ (2025)

The latest answers to your Kindle jailbreak questions: compatible firmware, risks, how-tos, downgrading, KUAL, KOReader, and more.
For real-time help, join the
Kindle Modding Discord
.

Is there a jailbreak for the latest Kindle firmware?

Yes. As of September 2025, the new
AdBreak jailbreak
works on firmware
5.18.1 through 5.18.5
, but only on devices with

Special Offers (ads) enabled
. It does not remove ads by itself — you still need Amazon to disable them afterward or use scripts.

If your device is on
5.18.0 or lower
, use
WinterBreak
.
If you are on
5.18.1–5.18.3 without ads
(such as Scribe models or unsupported regions), stay offline and wait for the upcoming

Unnamed Jailbreak (UJ)
.

AdBreak is very new – what should I know?

AdBreak was released in September 2025 and is still considered experimental. Issues are being discovered as more people try it,
and solutions will be added here over time. Always read the

official AdBreak guide

before attempting it.

What if my Kindle doesn’t support ads?

Some models, such as the
Scribe
, never supported ads at all — AdBreak will not work on them.

In some countries, Amazon does not offer ad-supported Kindles. A workaround is to

switch your Amazon account region
to a supported country (US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, JP, CN).

If you already paid Amazon to remove ads, you can re-enable them for free in your account settings, jailbreak, and then disable them again.

Can I downgrade my Kindle’s firmware?

No, not unless your Kindle is already jailbroken. There’s no official way to downgrade a stock (unjailbroken) Kindle.
Jailbroken users can sometimes downgrade using custom scripts; see the

downgrade guide
for more info.

How do I jailbreak my Kindle?

Check your Kindle’s firmware version, then follow the correct guide:

5.18.1–5.18.5 (ads enabled):

AdBreak Jailbreak

5.18.0 and lower:

WinterBreak Jailbreak

5.18.1–5.18.3 without ads:
Stay offline and wait for the Unnamed Jailbreak (UJ)

Do I need an Amazon account linked to my Kindle to jailbreak?

Yes, for AdBreak and WinterBreak your Kindle must be registered to an Amazon account with WiFi set up to download ads.
Older legacy jailbreaks sometimes did not require this.

Can I jailbreak a deregistered or blacklisted Kindle?

Usually not—unless your device is on specific old firmware and you use legacy exploits like LanguageBreak or WatchThis.
See the
official jailbreak guide
for details.

Will jailbreaking erase my books or highlights?

No, jailbreaking itself will not erase your books or highlights. Still, always back up your Kindle just in case.
Note: Amazon may remotely remove some sideloaded books when you reconnect to WiFi, whether your device is jailbroken or not.

Will jailbreaking void my warranty or get my Amazon account banned?

Jailbreaking will likely void your warranty. There are no confirmed cases of Amazon banning accounts for jailbreaking,
but you should never discuss mods or hacks with Amazon support.

Can I remove the jailbreak and restore my Kindle to stock?

A factory reset will remove most user data and disable jailbreak features, but some traces may remain.
For a complete restore, update your Kindle to the latest official firmware after resetting.

How can I block Kindle automatic updates?

The safest way is to keep your Kindle in Airplane Mode.
Some advanced users fill up their Kindle’s storage or use scripts to block updates,
but Airplane Mode is the easiest and safest for most people.

Can I still use the Amazon Store and all regular Kindle features after jailbreaking?

Yes. Jailbreaking does not remove or break normal Kindle features, including the store, cloud sync, and the built-in Kindle reader.

How do I install KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher)?

Copy the correct
Update_KUALBooklet*.bin
or hotfix install file to your Kindle’s root, safely eject,
then go to Settings → Update Your Kindle. If you get errors after updates, install the KUAL hotfix booklet.

KOReader or KUAL isn’t opening, or throws errors after updating. What should I do?

Make sure you have the correct version for your firmware.
Some updates require a KUAL hotfix, and KOReader has different builds for different firmware.
For detailed help, see the
KOReader thread
.

Can I sideload books or use the default Kindle reader after jailbreaking?

Yes! Jailbreaking does not affect your ability to sideload books or use the regular Kindle reader.
Most Kindle and third-party reading functions will work as before.

Can I install Android apps, or use Libby/Goodreads/Send To Kindle after jailbreaking?

You cannot run Android apps unless there is a specific port or extension.
Built-in Kindle features (Goodreads, Send To Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, etc.) still work after jailbreaking.

What’s the difference between soft-float and hard-float firmware?

Kindles on firmware 5.16.3 and newer use “hard-float” (hardware floating point support);
older devices use “soft-float.” Some mods or extensions only work on one or the other, so always check compatibility.

How do I know if my Kindle is jailbroken?

Type
;log
into the Kindle search bar. If you see a popup message, your device is jailbroken.

What should I do if something goes wrong, or my Kindle is stuck?

Try restarting your Kindle and reinstalling the hotfix and KUAL.
If that doesn’t work, check this FAQ again, the
Kindle Modding Wiki
,
or ask in the
Kindle Modding Discord
for help.

Kindle Jailbreak Guide 2025 – How to Jailbreak Your Kindle

Jailbreak your Kindle in 2025
with this trusted, up-to-date guide from KindleModShelf. Learn how to unlock your Kindle for KOReader, custom screensavers, emulators, and powerful third-party apps. Take control of your Kindle e-reader, protect your books, and explore features Amazon doesn't want you to have.

Why Jailbreak Your Kindle?

Jailbreaking your Kindle gives you the freedom to do more with your device and your books.
As of September 2025, firmware 5.18.1 through 5.18.5 can be jailbroken with AdBreak (ads required). Firmware 5.18.0 and lower use WinterBreak.

Freedom over your books:
Keep your e-books and documents truly yours—Amazon cannot change, remove, or restrict your files after jailbreaking.

Install powerful alternative reading apps like
KOReader
for EPUB, PDF, CBZ, and more formats plus advanced customization

Personalize your Kindle with custom screensavers or sleep images

Add apps: drawing, notes, audio playback, file manager, terminal, and classic games

Run Python or shell scripts—automate tasks or create your own Kindle tools

Block forced Amazon firmware updates and keep control of your device

Read EPUB and other eBook formats not natively supported by Kindle

Enable features like
dark mode
on older Kindles

Access more customization, accessibility, and privacy options

For a video overview, watch
Why Jailbreak Your Kindle?

Step-by-Step Kindle Jailbreak Instructions (2025)

Note:

Choose the jailbreak based on your firmware:

5.18.1–5.18.5 (ads enabled):
Use
AdBreak Jailbreak Guide

5.18.0 and lower:
Use
WinterBreak Jailbreak Guide

5.18.1–5.18.3 without ads:
Stay offline and wait for the upcoming Unnamed Jailbreak (UJ)

After jailbreaking:

Install the Hotfix to protect your jailbreak

Block OTA updates (airplane mode or storage filling method)

Install KOReader, screensavers, and other custom apps

===================

Jailbreaking on Mac – Kindle USB Requirements

← Back to Home

Jailbreaking on Mac

Jailbreaking from macOS depends on a reliable USB connection. Determine whether your Kindle needs extra drivers before you begin so the jailbreak scripts can access the device.

USB Connection Requirements

macOS communicates with Kindles over USB in two distinct ways depending on the device generation. Confirm which workflow applies to you before starting the jailbreak.

Modern Kindle Devices (USB-C)

Recent Kindle models with USB-C ports expose their storage over MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). macOS does not ship with native MTP support, so you must install an additional utility.

Required Software:

Amazon USB File Transfer

Installs Amazon’s Send to Kindle application, which bundles the MTP driver.

Once installed, your Kindle will appear in Finder and is accessible to jailbreak scripts.

Restart both the app and Finder if the Kindle does not mount immediately after installation.

Legacy Kindle Devices

Older Kindles with micro-USB ports expose their storage as classic USB Mass Storage. macOS supports this natively, so no additional software is required.

Connect the Kindle using its micro-USB cable.

The Kindle should mount in Finder automatically.

If Finder does not display the device, try a different cable or USB port.

Testing Your Connection

Plug your Kindle into the Mac with a known-good USB cable.

Open Finder and look for the Kindle in the sidebar.

If it appears, you can proceed directly with the jailbreak instructions.

If it does not appear, install the
Amazon USB File Transfer
application and reconnect.

Confirming USB access before starting prevents mid-jailbreak interruptions caused by missing MTP support.

Prerequisites

KTerm

Installation

Download the latest

Unzip it, then copy the

Notes

This is different from

because it can launch any jar file and it works on HF.

Should support soft-float OSs but is currently untested.

KAnki – Flashcards & Spaced Repetition for Kindle

← Back to Home

KANKI

KAnki
is an open-source flashcard app that brings true spaced repetition learning to Kindle e-readers. Study any language or subject, customize your decks, and track your progress—right from your Kindle.

Download

KAnki on GitHub

ABOUT KANKI

Inspired by Anki, KAnki runs natively on Kindle e-readers, supporting fully customizable vocabulary decks and a spaced repetition system to help you learn faster and remember longer. Use KAnki for Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin, or any subject.

WEB FLASHCARD EDITOR

You can create, import, edit, and organize your KAnki flashcard decks in your browser using our
KAnki Web Editor
by KindleModShelf. The editor lets you import your KAnki flashcard file, add and edit cards and decks, and see a live preview of what your cards will look like on your Kindle, with the ability to change the preview to match your Kindle model. For the best experience, use it on desktop or laptop.

KEY FEATURES

Add your own language fonts and vocabulary decks

Spaced repetition system for efficient memorization

Organize by level (JLPT, CEFR, HSK, etc.) and filter cards

Star/favorite important cards and practice both directions

Automatic progress tracking and error review mode

Optimized for e-ink and saves progress locally—no account needed

HOW TO INSTALL

Download the latest release from
KAnki on GitHub
.

Connect your Kindle to your computer via USB and unzip the downloaded file.

Customize for your language:

Edit
kanki/js/kanki_config.js
to set up your language, levels, and vocabulary. (You can use the
KAnki Web Editor
for this step!)

Add a compatible TTF font for your language, rename to
language.ttf
, and place in
kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf
if needed.

Copy the
KAnki
folder and
kanki.sh
script to your Kindle’s
documents
folder.

Disconnect your Kindle from the computer.

Find and launch KAnki from your Kindle’s home screen.

HOW TO USE

Study with touch: reveal answers, star key words, and monitor your stats.

Practice both directions (e.g., English↔Spanish).

Filter by proficiency level, and quickly review starred cards.

All stats and progress are saved locally for privacy and portability.

UPDATING KANKI

Back up your vocabulary or config files.

Replace the old KAnki folder with the new version.

Restore your data and fonts if needed.

Launch the app and use the Reload option to apply updates.

CUSTOMIZING FOR YOUR LANGUAGE

Add a TTF font for your language in
kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf
.

Edit
kanki/js/kanki_config.js
for your language, levels, and vocabulary. (Tip: Use the
KAnki Web Editor
for this!)

For languages with special scripts, add a
reading
field as needed.

Example deck setup:

var KANKI_CONFIG = {
language: "Spanish",
levels: ["A1", "A2", "B1"]
};
var VOCABULARY = {
"A1": [
{"front": "hello", "back": "hola", "notes": "Greeting"}
],
"A2": [
{"front": "tomorrow", "back": "mañana", "notes": "Time"}
]
};

DATA & TECHNICAL DETAILS

Progress and stats are saved locally—reset any time via the app or by deleting the storage file.

KAnki uses ES5 JavaScript and simple CSS for compatibility.

Some Kindle screen sizes may have layout quirks, but the app works on most models.

is a minimal drawing app for Kindle. Unleash your creativity and sketch directly on your e-ink device using tap-based modes.
See the examples page on GitHub to explore what others have created.

Download

Kreate on GitHub

Installation & Usage

Install through Kindle Forge (recommended):

Click the download button in Kindle Forge for

once installed.

Manual installation:

Copy the

folder and

file into
/mnt/us/documents

Launch
Kreate
from your Kindle Home screen by opening the booklet.

Notes

Kindle’s
kindle.gestures
API recognizes taps and only coarse swipe directions (up, down, left, right), not precise finger paths or endpoints.
This makes traditional “press-and-drag to draw” impossible.

To work around this,
Kreate
provides multiple drawing modes so you can choose exactly what to place — dots, lines, or curves.

Kreate automatically adapts to any Kindle screen size and model.

is the core tool for building, launching, and managing custom web apps on jailbroken Kindles, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the Mesquite engine.
Check out the
official Illusion project page

What is Illusion?

Illusion lets you turn any folder of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a real Kindle app—registered natively in the Mesquite launcher (just like the Kindle browser or Store). It’s perfect for making simple games, tools, or utilities using classic web tech. Illusion takes care of registration and launching—just write your app!

Features

Develop Kindle apps using only HTML, CSS, and ES5 JavaScript

Simple scriptlet-based install: just copy your app folder and scriptlet to Kindle

Fully documented—see the official site for a complete wiki, utilities, config guides, and FAQ

Works on all modern jailbroken Kindles with Mesquite support

How to Use

Illusion GitHub page
.
Everything you need—including sample projects, install scripts, and a full wiki—is there.

GNU Nano 8.x for Kindle – Terminal Text Editor (HF)

← Back to Home

GNU Nano 8.x for Kindle (HF)

Nano 8.x
is a terminal-first text editor packaged for Hardfloat (HF) Kindle builds. The package is available as
nano.zip
. Run the provided binary from the extracted folder with
./nano
. When connecting over SSH, set the terminal type first (for example
export TERM=linux
). Syntax highlighting can be enabled by passing a
nanorc
rules file using
-f nanorc
.

Features

Familiar terminal editing with standard Nano shortcuts (save, exit, search, cut/paste)

Small, fast binary suitable for quick on-device edits

Optional syntax highlighting via a
nanorc
rules file (use
-f nanorc
)

Runs in KTerm or over SSH

Requirements

Hardfloat (HF) Kindle build only.
The provided binary targets armhf/HF runtime.

KTerm
(on-device terminal) or SSH shell access.

External keyboard (Bluetooth or USB) recommended for comfortable editing.

How to Install

Download:
nano.zip
.

Extract the archive on your computer or copy the ZIP to the Kindle and extract it there.

Place the extracted folder on the Kindle (for example under
/mnt/us
or
/mnt/us/documents/nano
).

Make the binary executable if needed:

chmod +x /path/to/nano

If shared libraries are included, keep them next to the binary or ensure they are discoverable at runtime (rpath or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
).

How to Run

Run locally on the Kindle:

cd /path/to/extracted/folder
./nano filename.txt

Run over SSH:

When launching from a desktop terminal via SSH, set the terminal type first:

export TERM=linux
./nano filename.txt

Setting
TERM
can help Nano handle control keys correctly in SSH sessions.

Enable syntax highlighting:
Provide a nanorc rules file and pass it with
-f
:

./nano -f nanorc filename.txt
# or
./nano -f ./nanorc myfile.c

Troubleshooting

Permission denied
— possible causes:

File not executable (
chmod +x ./nano
).

Execution disabled on the mount being used; move the binary to a writable mount that permits exec (e.g.,
/mnt/us
).

Executable ABI incompatible with the device (verify armhf/HF).

Segfaults or immediate exits
— possible causes and checks:

ABI or shared library mismatches (ncurses or other libs).

Try running with bundled libraries using
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./
so the binary finds local libraries.

Confirm the binary's architecture where possible.

Key/terminal behavior over SSH
— set
TERM=linux
before launching Nano to normalize control-key handling.

Library search path
— ensure libraries are found via rpath or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
; host-side tools can adjust rpath before transfer if needed.

Notes

The distributed package targets HF (armhf) devices only; it will not work on non-HF/armel builds.

Results may vary across firmware versions; verify compatibility with your device and firmware before use.

An external keyboard greatly improves the editing experience.

===============

Page Header (KOReader Userpatch)

← Back to Home

Page Header (KOReader Userpatch)

KOReader userpatch
that mimics fiction-book page headers at the top of the screen—minimal, elegant, and configurable per book.

Features

Minimal, fiction-style header shown at the top of the screen.

Per-book controls: font, size, margin, letter-spacing, and padding.

Small-caps friendly; choose any installed font by filename.

Chapter-first pages: header hides automatically (like print books).

Cover pages: page number hidden (latest update).

Optional tweak to hide bottom page number on chapter pages.

Requirements

KOReader
installed on your Kindle.

How to Install

Download
2-page-header.lua
.

On your Kindle, open the KOReader folder. If a folder named
patches
does not exist, create it.

Place
2-page-header.lua
in the
patches
folder.

Restart KOReader.

Configure

Open the top menu →
Settings (cog)
→
Status Bar
→
Page Header
.

Set
font
(filename only),
font size
,
margin
,
letter-spacing
, and
padding
. These are saved per book.

Prefer a small-caps font for the best look. If body text overlaps, increase the book’s
top margin
.

Downloads

2-page-header.lua

Technical Notes

Defaults:
open the Lua file and find
-- Defaults
(around line 20) to set default font, size, margin, and letter-spacing.

Font name:
set the font by filename only (e.g.,
EBGaramondSC.ttf
), no paths; some fonts use
.otf
.

Missing font:
if a book references a font you later remove or rename, KOReader will show an error—pick a valid font in settings.

Chapter-first page:
the header intentionally hides and the page number moves to the bottom. To always hide the bottom page number, change
if page_bottom or first_page_of_chapter then
to
if page_bottom then
(around line 677).

Cover page tweak:
ensures the page number no longer shows on cover pages.

Device notes:
reported working well on Kindle Scribe; adjust margins and font size to taste.

Forgot Parental Controls Password (Jailbreak Prep)

← Back to Home

Forgot Parental Controls Password?

If parental controls are enabled and you’ve forgotten the password, you cannot jailbreak until they are disabled. WinterBreak requires access to the Kindle Store, which parental controls block.
Use the official Amazon reset methods below, then follow the jailbreak precautions.

Resetting Parental Controls — 6th Gen and Newer

Forgot your parental controls password? Reset it using the following steps:

On your Kindle, go to
Settings
→
Parental Controls
.

Tap the passcode field.

Enter:
111222777
and tap
OK
.

This will perform a
factory reset
, which erases all data including the parental controls password, lock screen passcode, and downloaded content.

Source:
Amazon Help — Reset Parental Controls (6th Gen and newer)

Resetting Parental Controls — 5th Gen

If you’re using a Kindle 5th Gen model, follow these steps:

On your Kindle, go to
Settings
→
Parental Controls
.

In the passcode field, type:
resetmykindle

Press the
Enter
key (below the
Del
key).

This will also perform a
factory reset
, removing all personal information, parental controls, and downloaded content.

Source:
Amazon Help — Reset Parental Controls (5th Gen)

After the Reset

Once the factory reset is complete:

Your Kindle will be wiped clean.

You’ll need to sign back in with your Amazon account
later
.

Re-enter Wi-Fi credentials and re-download your books once it’s safe to connect.

Important: Prevent Automatic Updates

After a reset, as soon as the Kindle connects to Wi-Fi, Amazon will attempt to install the latest firmware update. If that update is applied, it
will permanently block the jailbreak
.

Unless you have a very old Kindle that Amazon no longer updates, this step is
absolutely crucial
.

Before signing in or connecting to Wi-Fi, completely fill the Kindle’s storage to 100%.

Use dummy files or a storage filler tool to ensure no free space remains.

Only after the Kindle is fully filled should you connect to the Internet and sign in to your Amazon account.

screenControl
lets you view and interact with your Kindle’s screen remotely, straight from your web browser.

Remote screen viewing:
See your Kindle’s display in real time through your web browser.

Send clicks and interact with the Kindle interface from your computer.

Works on both softfloat (SF) and hardfloat (HF) Kindles.

No known risk of bricking your Kindle when used as intended.

See live updates of your Kindle screen

Click anywhere on the Kindle screen from your browser to interact

Automate tasks by sending clicks or scripts

Supports both SF and HF Kindle firmwares (tested up to 5.18.x)

Perfect for automation, bulk book downloads, or DeDRM workflows

Installation

Download:

screenControl.tar.gz

Extract the archive on your computer.

Copy the extracted files to your Kindle’s
/mnt/us/extensions/
directory.

Optional:
To use from KUAL, make a KUAL-compatible folder/script, or run the .sh script directly in KTerm.

Start the script from KUAL or by running it in your terminal emulator.

How to Use

Find your Kindle’s IP address:

Open KTerm and run
ip a
to display your Kindle’s IP address.

Tips & Troubleshooting

Not showing up in KUAL?
Make sure the folder/script is placed in
/mnt/us/extensions/

Script not appearing as a book?
Only .sh scripts appear as books—make a KUAL wrapper for easier access if needed.

To stop screenControl:
Restart your Kindle, or run
killall screenControlHF
or
killall screenControl
in KTerm.

Lag or slow updates?
Display speed depends on your network and Kindle model.

Safe to use:

Advanced Uses

Developers can use screenControl to test Kindle apps, debug layouts, or automate repetitive tasks.

The tool supports sending click events programmatically, so you can automate actions or integrate it into scripts.

Enjoy classic Tetris directly in the terminal window!

Notes

This version works
only
on hardfloat (HF) firmware models. It is not compatible with softfloat (SF) devices.

You must launch Tetris from inside KTerm; it is not a standalone app or menu item.

Want Game Boy Tetris? Use a Game Boy emulator instead for easier playing.

Textadept for Kindle – Desktop-grade Text Editor (HF)

← Back to Home

Textadept for Kindle

Textadept
is a compact, desktop-grade text editor brought to Kindle (HF). Fast, scriptable in Lua, and packed with developer features — multi-buffer, split view, lexer-based highlighting, and a command palette. Includes both a GTK-based graphical interface and a CLI interface for KTerm.

Features

Multi-buffer editing and split views (side-by-side)

Lexer-based syntax highlighting for many languages

Command palette for quick commands and actions

Completely scriptable and extensible in
Lua

Graphical GTK UI & a lightweight CLI interface that runs in KTerm

Small footprint and fast startup — suited to HF Kindle builds

Requirements

Hardfloat (HF) Kindle build only
— Textadept requires HF runtime support

Mesquite / Illusion environment for GUI integration (if using GTK frontend)

KTerm
(terminal) available for CLI usage

External Bluetooth keyboard recommended (see Bugs)

How to Install

Download
textadept.zip

Either:

Unzip on your computer and copy the resulting folder and any included
.sh
launcher to your Kindle's
documents
folder, or

Copy the zip to the Kindle and extract it on-device (if you prefer extracting directly on the Kindle).

If there is a launcher script (
.sh
), make it executable and place it in
/mnt/us/documents
so it appears as a tappable "book" on the Home screen.

To run the terminal interface, open KTerm and launch the included CLI binary or wrapper script from the Textadept folder.

For the GUI, launch the supplied GTK frontend (requires Mesquite / Illusion integration and HF runtime).

How to Use

CLI (KTerm):
Open KTerm and run the included textadept CLI. Ideal when using the Kindle touchscreen + on-screen keyboard or when GTK is not usable.

GUI (GTK):
Launch the GTK interface for mouse-like menus, split panes, and the command palette. Best with an external keyboard for shortcuts.

Use the command palette to quickly open files, switch buffers, or run Lua commands.

All editor functionality is scriptable — read the included Lua snippets and the manual to extend behavior and add shortcuts.

Known Issues

Software keyboard bug:
When using the GTK graphical interface, the Kindle's software keyboard may disappear when a modal dialog opens. This is a known GTK integration issue.

Workaround: use a Bluetooth/external keyboard or use the KTerm CLI interface until the dialog/keyboard issue is resolved.

If you encounter crashes or missing lexers, check the included log or open the CLI to see error output.

Documentation

Read the included
manual
and
API
files in the Textadept folder for usage, keyboard shortcuts, and Lua extension examples.

Command palette and keybindings are configurable via Lua — the docs show sample bindings for common editing tasks.

Textadept brings a desktop-grade editing experience to HF Kindles. If you use an external keyboard or prefer terminal workflows, it's a powerful and lightweight editor worth learning.

Universal Paperclips for Kindle – Idle Clicker Game Webapp

← Back to Home

Universal Paperclips

Universal Paperclips
is an idle clicker game where you play as an AI obsessed with making paperclips.
This version runs as a webapp on any jailbroken Kindle e-reader, so you can play right on your device — using the terminal and Mesquite browser.

About the Game

Classic incremental game by Frank Lantz (originally released in 2017)

Start by clicking to make single paperclips, then automate your factory and take over the world — one paperclip at a time!

Inspired by Nick Bostrom’s thought experiment about AI and unintended consequences

Requirements

Jailbroken Kindle e-reader

KTerm terminal
installed

How to Install

Download the game:

Download Paperclips.zip

Unzip the file on your computer.

Copy the extracted files to your Kindle (place them in your preferred directory, such as
/extensions
or
/documents
).

Eject and disconnect your Kindle.

How to Play

Open KTerm on your Kindle.

Navigate to the Paperclips directory using
cd
.

Run the game with:
./paperclips

Enjoy turning the world into paperclips — right in your Kindle terminal using the Mesquite browser!

Notes

Works on all modern jailbroken Kindles.

You must launch via KTerm; the game does not appear as a standalone app.

Display and layout are tuned for Kindle PW5 (1200×1600 px) but work on other models as well.

A full playthrough has not been completed — expect possible visual glitches in later stages.

Performance may slow down as more paperclips are produced.
