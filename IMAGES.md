## About KindleModShelf.me

The goal of KindleModShelf is to highlight the great work done by the community that for over a decade has been jailbreaking Kindles, and make this material easy to access on one site instead of needing to find it all yourself - accessible to everyone!

## About These Images

All images in the gallery were collected from the Kindle Modding Discord (a public Discord server available to everyone), with a few exceptions that were directly submitted by users.

We do NOT own this content and CANNOT give you permission to use it.

We credit creators by including usernames/handles when known.

## Why We Host Them

15+ years of Kindle modding knowledge is disappearing:
- Discord deletes old messages
- Forums shut down
- Image hosts expire
- Creators go inactive

We're preserving this before it's lost forever.

## Legal Status

We don't have explicit permission from every creator.

We host this because:
- It was posted publicly in the Kindle Modding Discord (a public server)
- It has educational and historical value
- No commercial market is being harmed
- We credit creators where known
- We remove content on request

This is archival preservation, not commercial exploitation.
