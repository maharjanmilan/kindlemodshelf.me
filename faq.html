      <p>Common questions and answers about Kindle jailbreaking, troubleshooting, and modding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: When is the 5.18.x jailbreak coming out?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Soon - hopefully. There is no ETA given, and side projects, such as KPM (Kindle Package Manager), KindleForge (GUI for KPM), Sh_Integration in C, New jb.sh must be finished too. The in-development jailbreak supports 5.16.4 - 5.18.3 in theory, 5.18.4 patches the jailbreak and will not be supported for a while. No, there is nothing you can do at this time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Can I downgrade my Kindle?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Only if you are jailbroken first. See kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downgrading/#downgrading.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: The Kindle Disk Filler script isn't working!</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You are likely on an MTP kindle. You can manually fill your kindle with junk files. github.com/bastianmarin/Kindle-Filler-Disk/tree/main/MTP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Ensure to delete any .partial.tmp.bin files or something of that sort when completing this step to prevent updates if you are susceptible to them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: ;log mrpi fails</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Drag the .bin file to the root of your kindle and press update your kindle in settings. This works functionally the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Ensure to delete any .partial.tmp.bin files or something of that sort when completing this step to prevent updates if you are susceptible to them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: MRPI says 'Destroying ...bin'/Update fails on the previous step</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You have an incorrect .bin file. Ensure you are using the correct/compatible KUAL edition (try the other) or software update.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: KUAL Says 'Application Error'</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Run the 'Run Hotfix/Bridge' scriptlet.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Updated to 5.18.x post-jailbreak (e.g. during blocking OTAs)</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You may still be jailbroken! search for ;log and if it says something along the lines of "no args passed", you are still jailbroken, reinstall mrpi & kual and run hotfix, it should work.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: KOReader isn't opening!</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You have the incorrect KOReader version. Refer to this table to find out which version you need:
      </p>
      <p>
        kindle-legacy: K2, DX, K3 (and all variants)<br>

    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Create an empty file named "DISABLE_CORE_DUMP" (no extension) in the kindle root.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: How can I prevent updates on 5.18.1-3 whilst waiting?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Fill up your kindle with junk files, either manually or with the filler script, forget networks, and enable aeroplane mode. kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/prevent-auto-update.html.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: When copying winterbreak, I recieve "The file name you specified is not valid or too long."</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Either you have really long file names, or forgot to extract the winterbreak files. Extract them first, and this should be fixed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Do I need a registered kindle to jailbreak?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Jailbreaking on a blacklisted Kindle?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>

    <div class="section-title">Q: My Mac doesn't see my kindle!</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Kindle store encounters an 'Unexpected Error'</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Try the below solution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Factory Reset your Kindle</li>
        <li>Before registering - plug your Kindle into your PC, move the WinterBreak files to the root of your storage space</li>
        <li>Login to your account, and enable Airplane mode as soon as possible</li>
        <li>Connect your Kindle into your PC and delete the cache directory at the path .active_content_sandbox/store/resource/LocalStorage (skip this step if the LocalStorage directory does not exist)</li>
        <li>Reboot your Kindle</li>
        <li>Open the Kindle Store on your Kindle</li>
        <li>When prompted, click Yes to turn off Airplane mode</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Still doesn't work?
      </p>
      <p>
        Force update to your current firmware, even if you have disabled OTA Updates. Quote: "You can also force an update by copying the firmware update file to your Kindle and, while still plugged in, hold down the power button until it restarts." Get the firmware version from here: kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downloading-updates.html.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: PW1 Running KOReader keeps crashing/flashing the default screensaver</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Run KOReader in frameworkless instead.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: How to jailbreak K4/K4 jailbreaking issues</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Refer to the following reddit thread: reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1ipko3u/comment/mcvmj3s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: I cannot load Mesquito</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: If you are on firmwares below 5.16.4, follow the Winterbreak2 guide. Otherwise, force the store to use cache and not the remote by connecting to wifi without a true valid internet connection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: On 5.16.3, Cannot jailbreak, 'WINTERBREAK JAILBREAK' appears at the top of the screen</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Update manually to 5.16.4, .3 is not supported. It has been reported not to work on .3 in multiple cases.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: How does WinterBreak/Jailbreaking work/What programming languages do I need to know to get into Jailbreaking?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Look at this. Read it fully to understand. The actual exploit is fully detailed in the "Exploits" section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jailbreaking works by finding different ways to run sh as root on the kindle, and on most other devices you can jailbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, depending on the exploit. But definetely sh, so you can actually run the jb code.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Illusion isn't working/Illusion 'application error'!</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Illusion requires LanguageBreak/WinterBreak with scriptlets (Universal Hotfix), and does not currently support 5.6.1.1. Ensure you meet this criteria, and try rebooting and clicking again if you are, indeed, compatible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Where can I find apps/tweaks?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Check out kindlemodshelf.me
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: How can I set a custom screensaver?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Look at the KOReader Guide (koreader.rocks). Manually replacing the screensavers/using NiLuJe's screensaver hack is not recommended, highly dangerous as the kindle is very specific around image formatting and type. Could lead to bricks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Whats SF/HF and why does some software not work on my device?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Kindle firmware is SF on 5.16.2.1.1 and below. After 5.16.3, all kindle firmware is HF. SF software may not work on HF, and vice versa. That's why you need to select the correct package for your kindle when installing something.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Can I not do x after jailbreaking?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You should still be able to do everything you could do post-jailbreak as you would on an unjailbroken kindle. Jailbreaking itself doesnt visually change anything unless you install apps or tweaks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Cannot install hotfix, no matter what.</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: You are probably not actually jailbroken!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Q: Any other issues?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      <p>
        A: Ask the kindle modding discord, or read the guide (kindlemodding.org).
      </p>
